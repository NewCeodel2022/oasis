NOVEMBER 5TH, 1996

4
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,361
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

5
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:58,618
But Dad!

6
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,870
We'll come back for Ho-doo.

7
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,080
When?

8
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,873
Mr. Na!

9
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,543
Are you setting us up for a fall?
Come out!

10
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:08,876
Moon-young.

11
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,551
- Let's go.
- Ho-doo.

12
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:50,626
Moon-young!

13
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,093
There you are. I've been looking for you.

14
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,054
Do you remember me?

15
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:01,056
I'm your dad's friend.

16
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,099
NA MOON-YOUNG

17
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,768
Well,

18
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:07,854
I'm supposed to meet your dad today.

19
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,440
Do you know where he is?

20
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:18,907
Jae-pil.

21
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,658
Friends are indeed the best.

22
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:24,120
You should've told me
about your situation.

23
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,706
- Here, drink up.
- Thanks.

24
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,958
You silly.

25
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,630
Just down it.

26
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,964
I'll pour you some more.

27
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,167
Moon-young.

28
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:18,842
I have to die...

29
00:04:21,344 --> 00:04:22,470
for you to live.

30
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:54,627
YEAR 2023

31
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,909
I like your lipstick.

32
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,787
- You do?
- Yes, it goes well with your outfit.

33
00:05:30,455 --> 00:05:32,624
"Look upside down and between your legs."

34
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,209
"Then you can see me."

35
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,361
I'm not sure about this.

36
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:04,280
I don't think a mother
should look so pretty.

37
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:08,201
It's been two years since I've had fun.

38
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,703
I can't wear sweatpants.

39
00:06:09,953 --> 00:06:11,621
You're going out to have fun?

40
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:15,667
I thought you were wining and dining
Prosecutor Joo Sin-hwa.

41
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:17,293
Hey, Cha Sung-jae.

42
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:20,005
Right.

43
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,132
Cheer up the old man, okay?

44
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,217
She just moved to Haejeon City
and must be lonely.

45
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,264
And find out what's going on
at the Prosecutors' Office.

46
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,141
Now that I think about it,

47
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:33,309
the future of our law firm depends on you.

48
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,478
You're impossible.

49
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:38,481
If you want to stay home,
that's fine with me.

50
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,317
We already have Bom, which is "spring."

51
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,610
Let's go for all four seasons.

52
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,362
That's a terrible idea!

53
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:46,281
- You're ridiculous.
- Come on.

54
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,491
There's still time before you go.

55
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,286
MORINO HIDE AND SEEK

56
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,705
Bom, I'll see you later!

57
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:55,999
Mom!

58
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:07,508
Bom.

59
00:07:06,468 --> 00:07:08,595
I made you fried rice for dinner.

60
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,431
Dad didn't make it?

61
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,558
My fried rice is good too.

62
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,019
I'll make sure Bom eats.

63
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,313
Don't drink too much, Ms. Na.

64
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:21,066
I can't even if I want to, Mr. Cha.

65
00:07:21,775 --> 00:07:22,817
I'll be back soon.

66
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,694
Okay. See you!

67
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,446
"See you!"

68
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:38,166
Hey, Na Moon-young!

69
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,376
You've still got it.

70
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,544
I've missed drinking.

71
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:43,296
Let me pour you one.

72
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:46,381
Let's do this.

73
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,675
- Come on.
- Bring it on.

74
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,473
It's nice to have alcohol in my system.

75
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:57,143
I see you've been holding back a lot.

76
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,854
My poor old man.

77
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:01,773
We should be celebrating...

78
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:05,318
the start of your new post
in a better place than this.

79
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,653
What did you say?

80
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,363
Stop calling me an old man.

81
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,199
Sung-jae made me promise

82
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,617
to wine and dine you.

83
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:16,246
You two were just made for each other.

84
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,164
I got divorced and demoted.

85
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:19,582
Stop rubbing it in my face.

86
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,042
You're so annoying.

87
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:24,045
Why is a law firm figurehead
trying to work an angle on me?

88
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:28,258
Because it's the only way I can save face.

89
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:31,469
I quit my job as a prosecutor

90
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,431
and moved down here to be a good mom.

91
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,559
But Bom is still attached to her dad,

92
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,104
and I still can't cook
even though I study hard.

93
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:43,690
You can't learn how to cook by studying.

94
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,232
Whatever.

95
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,526
Give it up already.

96
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,862
The one who's good at cooking
should do it.

97
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,613
Maybe you're right.

98
00:08:55,785 --> 00:08:56,786
Hey, two o'clock.

99
00:08:58,621 --> 00:08:59,789
Don't be so obvious.

100
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:02,334
Those bastards are having an affair.

101
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,002
How can you tell?

102
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,255
Do you see the security camera?

103
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,968
They're sitting in a dark corner,
which happens to be a blind spot.

104
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,346
That's reasonable grounds for suspicion.

105
00:09:15,013 --> 00:09:16,431
Look at their suitcases.

106
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,975
Their families must think
they're on a work trip.

107
00:09:23,104 --> 00:09:24,189
Excuse me, Ms. Joo.

108
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:27,525
Please calm down and have a drink.

109
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,653
And stop accusing
innocent people at a bar.

110
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,697
I'm telling you I'm right.

111
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,657
I've been through it, remember?

112
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,868
Look at his face.

113
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,703
He looks like Yoo Jung...

114
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:40,997
Damn it, I mean...

115
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:44,125
He looks like Mr. Yoo, my ex-husband.

116
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:48,922
In any case,

117
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:51,174
I'm now officially and legally single,

118
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,509
so you need to set me up.

119
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,470
He has to be way better than my stupid ex.

120
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:56,971
Maybe I will.

121
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,435
This is a surprise.

122
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,020
Who knew you'd get drunk first?

123
00:10:04,521 --> 00:10:06,356
Who said I was drunk?

124
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:09,943
What's wrong with me?

125
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,196
- Hello.
- Hi there.

126
00:10:13,697 --> 00:10:15,949
Would it be okay to join you ladies?

127
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,243
No, thank...

128
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,413
Where should we go?

129
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,290
There's a private room over there.

130
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,251
If it's okay with you, join us.

131
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,294
Sounds good.

132
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,047
Hey, Moon-young.

133
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,589
Let's go.

134
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,881
- Eat some fruit.
- No.

135
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,591
Then how about the vegetables?

136
00:11:15,425 --> 00:11:17,425
Come on.

137
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,635
You like these.

138
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,765
What are you folding, Bom?

139
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:23,433
Eat this.

140
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,019
You can eat while you do that.

141
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:29,564
Here. Have some protein.

142
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,358
Who do you take after?

143
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:32,734
You, Dad.

144
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:35,612
I can't argue with that.

145
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,746
Just have two more bites.

146
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,039
- No.
- What about this?

147
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,333
- Ms. Ha made it.
- Really?

148
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:49,959
Open wide.

149
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,543
You silly.

150
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,007
I'll pick you up as soon as you're done,

151
00:11:56,091 --> 00:11:57,300
so come right out, okay?

152
00:11:57,592 --> 00:11:59,592
Okay.

153
00:12:12,816 --> 00:12:13,942
Did you hurt yourself?

154
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,319
Oh, I nicked myself cutting fruit.

155
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,035
How did I get home last night?

156
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:29,205
Oh, no!

157
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,000
That's so hot.

158
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,252
I'm late to court.

159
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,878
- Just have one more bite.
- No.

160
00:12:37,382 --> 00:12:39,009
- Can you clean up?
- Sure.

161
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,012
Hey, wait for me!

162
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:45,015
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

163
00:12:45,515 --> 00:12:47,515
There we go.

164
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,818
Take care of that hangover.

165
00:12:59,696 --> 00:13:01,031
The car needs washing.

166
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,408
Hey, you're right.

167
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,783
See you later.

168
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,173
Ms. Na!

169
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:21,259
Ms. Ha.

170
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,638
- Good morning.
- Goodness.

171
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,557
What are you up to today?

172
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:30,977
I got some fresh strawberries,
so I'm making tarts.

173
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:33,646
- That sounds delicious.
- There's pumpkin too.

174
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,440
Bom likes pumpkin puree, right?

175
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:37,233
Should I bring some by later?

176
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:39,110
Yes, thank you.

185
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:01,735
He left for work?

186
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,530
No, it's not for a broadcast.

187
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:07,073
We're too busy for that.

188
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:08,908
I'm going to lose it.

189
00:15:09,034 --> 00:15:11,369
If you don't know where he is,
then who does?

190
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,413
He took off right after work yesterday.

191
00:15:13,496 --> 00:15:14,998

193

No, not at all.

194
00:15:20,211 --> 00:15:21,713
<i>- Get going.</i>
- I'll look into--

195
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,715
<i>- I said to get going right now!</i>
- What?

196
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,424
Me?

197
00:15:25,383 --> 00:15:27,677
Mr. Cha's missing,
and the legal advisor's on a work trip.

198
00:15:27,761 --> 00:15:29,554
You're the only attorney left.

199
00:15:30,055 --> 00:15:32,055
Head to court

200
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,599
and review the case on the way.

201
00:15:32,682 --> 00:15:33,808
Wait, Ms. Ko.

202
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,060
I don't think...

203
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,561
Right now isn't a good...

204
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:45,528
<i>Remember Geumsin Development?</i>

205
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:47,530
<i>Mr. Cha worked for them in Seoul.</i>

206
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,367
<i>Geumsin is developing a resort</i>
<i>in Haean Village,</i>

207
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,827
<i>but a resident refused</i>
<i>to sell his land to them.</i>

208
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:54,204
<i>He got hit by a car and died.</i>

209
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:56,414
<i>The suspect is</i>
<i>a female employee at Geumsin.</i>

210
00:15:59,334 --> 00:16:01,211
A female employee? And the victim?

211
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:02,837
<i>A man in his 50s.</i>

212
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:05,215
<i>She would've been found guilty,</i>

213
00:16:05,382 --> 00:16:06,716
<i>but a witness came forward</i>

214
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,843
<i>and claimed the victim</i>
<i>jumped in front of the car.</i>

215
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:10,136
A witness?

216
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,308
<i>Today's the first witness examination</i>

217
00:16:15,392 --> 00:16:17,352
<i>and our only chance to turn the tables.</i>

218
00:16:18,061 --> 00:16:20,230
<i>I sent In-kyu there. He'll fill you in.</i>

219
00:16:23,525 --> 00:16:25,819
He wouldn't miss
an important trial like this.

00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,853
This is Attorney Na Moon-young.

223
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,521
She's a managing partner

224
00:17:43,605 --> 00:17:45,523
and was a prosecutor for 12 years.

225
00:17:46,358 --> 00:17:48,026
This is Mr. Ma Kang from Geumsin

226
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:49,736
and our client, Ms. Kim Yoon-sun.

227
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,863
Nice to meet you.

00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,908
I'm Na Moon-young,
and I'm a managing partner at Cha Woong.

229
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,243
Where's Attorney Cha?

230
00:17:57,994 --> 00:17:59,579
Is he not coming today?

231
00:18:00,663 --> 00:18:02,624
Something urgent came up.

232
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,378
Please don't worry.

233
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,173
Tell me.

234
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,593
What's so urgent
that an attorney can't show up

235
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:15,428
for a trial?

236
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:18,598
I'm terribly sorry.

237
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,809
I promise the trial will go accordingly.

238
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,311
Mr. Cho, where's the witness?

239
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,355
Here he comes.

240
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:28,815
Mr. Do Jin-woo.

241
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:43,998
Mr. Do.

242
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:45,709
This is Attorney Na Moon-young.

243
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,378
She's taking Mr. Cha's place
because he couldn't come.

244
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,921
Why couldn't he?

245
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:52,007
I promise the trial will go accordingly.

246
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:54,590
I'm sorry,

247
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,761
but are you wearing that on the stand?

248
00:18:58,555 --> 00:19:01,016
It's important for the witness
to appear reliable.

249
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:04,561
Mr. Cho, give him your suit.

250
00:19:04,894 --> 00:19:05,895
Yes, ma'am.

251
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:07,063
Excuse me?

252
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,789
I can't go in like this.

253
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,999
It's not bad.

254
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,337
Hey.

255
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:32,172
What's taking Ms. Kim so long?

256
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,674
I'll go check on her.

257
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:51,939
She's gone, sir.

258
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:56,903
Damn it!

259
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,576
<i>So are you saying...</i>

260
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,619
DEFENDANT

261
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,538
...the defendant has failed to appear?

262
00:20:14,172 --> 00:20:16,549
You submitted a letter of non-attendance

263
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,094
for the defendant
ten minutes prior to trial.

264
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:23,640
The defense counsel has changed too.

265
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,313
Yes, Your Honor.

266
00:20:30,397 --> 00:20:33,024
I'd like it to be known
that the substitution of counsel

267
00:20:33,108 --> 00:20:36,528
and motion for continuance
are not an attempt to delay this trial.

268
00:20:37,028 --> 00:20:39,781
The defendant
suddenly fell ill while waiting

269
00:20:39,864 --> 00:20:41,366
outside the courtroom--

270
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:50,041
I don't need to know

271
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,669
the defendant's personal reasons
for not being here.

272
00:20:53,837 --> 00:20:55,880
Can she be here a month from now?

273
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:58,548
Excuse me?

274
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,301
Yes, Your Honor.

275
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,929
I'll make sure she appears.

276
00:21:03,013 --> 00:21:05,013
But Your Honor!

277
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,682
The trial will be postponed

278
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,809
to the 17th of next month,

279
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:10,812
and closing arguments
will be held on the 24th.

280
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:13,940
If there are
additional statements or evidence,

281
00:21:14,274 --> 00:21:16,151
submit them in a timely manner.

282
00:21:17,694 --> 00:21:20,280
Let's move on
to the next case on the docket.

00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,734
Why isn't he answering?

286
00:21:58,068 --> 00:21:59,194
What's wrong with him?

287
00:21:59,527 --> 00:22:01,029
He should at least answer.

288
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,406
We were done in five minutes,

289
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:06,576
but the defendant ran off
while we were dealing with the witness.

290
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,245
We lucked out because the judge was nice.

291
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:12,540
I know, right?

292
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,376
Maybe Mr. Cha took off on purpose.

293
00:22:14,501 --> 00:22:16,086
He didn't want to try this case.

294
00:22:17,253 --> 00:22:19,089
Mr. Cha didn't want to try this case?

295
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:23,134
You could tell

296
00:22:23,468 --> 00:22:25,679
that he didn't want to.

297
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:28,554
Why?

298
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:30,642
I'm not sure myself.

299
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:15,437
Ms. Na, please watch the road.

300
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:22,944

301
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,455

00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,540
Ma'am?

303
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,842
Ma'am, please...

304
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,262
Hold on.

305
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:52,557
It's a red light!

306
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,478
Ms. Na!

307
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:06,613
Seriously. What's gotten into you?

00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,848

This wall encroached on our land by 30cm.

319
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,778
I've already told Mr. Cha many times.

They're just thieves!

I've already explained
all of this to that male attorney.

00:25:41,207 --> 00:25:42,208
Do I have to repeat it?

324
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,170

327
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:05,774
Any word from Mr. Cha?

328
00:26:07,275 --> 00:26:08,276
No, not at all.

329
00:26:10,153 --> 00:26:11,613
He's probably fine, right?

330
00:26:12,572 --> 00:26:14,991
I called the police and 911 just in case,

331
00:26:15,867 --> 00:26:16,993
but I got nothing.

332
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,040
Maybe he's just out getting some air.

333
00:26:23,124 --> 00:26:25,168
Or maybe he's out getting someone.

334
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:26,836
He could've run off, you know.

335
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,588
Do you think he'd do that?

336
00:26:28,672 --> 00:26:30,173
That's more your type of thing.

337
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,801
What do you mean? I've never dated.

338
00:26:33,301 --> 00:26:34,302
Stop that.

339
00:26:38,181 --> 00:26:40,141
Mr. Ma from Geumsin keeps telling us

340
00:26:40,225 --> 00:26:41,309
to find Mr. Cha.

341
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,938
Have you reached Ms. Kim?

342
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:47,440
She's not responding either.

343
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:50,193
What's going on with everyone today?

344
00:26:51,194 --> 00:26:53,697
When you reach her,
inform her of the postponed trial date

345
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,281
and that if she doesn't appear again,

346
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,242
it'll affect the sentencing.

347
00:27:00,912 --> 00:27:02,080
Hey, Attorney Choi.

348
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,499
Have you seen Sung-jae today?

349
00:27:06,209 --> 00:27:09,170
I thought he might've gone
to the bar association workshop.

350
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:12,173
I see.

351
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:16,553
I have a call coming in.
Talk to you later.

352
00:27:19,848 --> 00:27:20,849
Bom?

00:27:20,932 --> 00:27:22,517
<i>Mom, where are you?</i>

354
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,519
<i>Dad's not answering his phone.</i>

355
00:27:24,978 --> 00:27:26,312
Oh, my. Are classes over?

356
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,316
Just wait a bit.
I'm heading there right now.

357
00:27:30,692 --> 00:27:32,819
- Okay?
<i>- It's not that.</i>

358
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:34,988
<i>I brought Bom home myself.</i>

359
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,280
Mother?

360
00:27:48,501 --> 00:27:51,004
You should've told me you were busy.

361
00:27:51,254 --> 00:27:53,923
What if something had happened to Bom?

362
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:57,427
I'm sorry.
I couldn't get in touch with Sung-jae.

363
00:27:57,969 --> 00:27:59,721
I heard Sung-jae's been busy.

364
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,307
Something urgent must've come up.

365
00:28:03,266 --> 00:28:06,269
It's just that he wouldn't skip
an important trial like this.

366
00:28:07,979 --> 00:28:11,775
Moon-young, you need to stop
jumping to conclusions.

367
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:14,361
I suppose

368
00:28:14,444 --> 00:28:17,697
it's understandable
that you're having a hard time

369
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:19,449
because my husband

370
00:28:20,367 --> 00:28:22,118
is in Seoul right now.

371
00:28:22,994 --> 00:28:25,830
He promised to pick up Bom today,

372
00:28:25,914 --> 00:28:27,707
but if Bom didn't hear from him...

373
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:29,626
Sung-jae is a grown man.

374
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:33,296
Hold on.

375
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,632
Did you two have a fight?

376
00:28:36,174 --> 00:28:37,217
No.

377
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,136
Then he'll be back soon.

378
00:28:41,971 --> 00:28:43,515
Here. Take this to Bom.

379
00:28:44,224 --> 00:28:45,350
She's in her room.

380
00:29:33,023 --> 00:29:38,486
MR. MA KANG

381
00:29:44,701 --> 00:29:45,827
Yes, sir?

382
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,704
<i>You have one hour to get here.</i>

383
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:50,206
<i>If you don't, I'll kill you.</i>

384
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,874
<i>Got it?</i>

385
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:54,169
Then bring Mr. Cha!

386
00:29:54,878 --> 00:29:57,172
I can't go to trial without him!

387
00:30:10,810 --> 00:30:12,810
SUNG-JAE

388
00:30:11,811 --> 00:30:12,854
<i>What the hell is this?</i>

389
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,606
<i>I won't take the fall.</i>

390
00:30:15,815 --> 00:30:17,067
<i>You need to call me.</i>

391
00:30:17,692 --> 00:30:19,692
<i>Right now!</i>

392
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,408
Kim Yoon-sun. Cha Sung-jae.

393
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:29,746
Have they lost their damn minds?

394
00:30:30,205 --> 00:30:32,207
Why are they making things so difficult?

395
00:30:34,417 --> 00:30:35,418
Has Mr. Cha called?

396
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:37,087
Not yet, sir.

397
00:30:41,633 --> 00:30:43,301
I thought we were on the same page.

398
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:47,263
I wonder what he's plotting.

399
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,809
Hey.

400
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:53,770
- This is pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

401
00:30:55,438 --> 00:30:57,649
Mom, when will Dad be back?

402
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:00,068
I'm not sure.

403
00:31:00,276 --> 00:31:01,695
He's running late, isn't he?

404
00:31:02,153 --> 00:31:03,446
Should we try calling him?

405
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:04,614
Okay.

406
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,245
SUNG-JAE

407
00:31:10,328 --> 00:31:12,038
SIN-HWA

408
00:31:14,666 --> 00:31:16,584
Sin-hwa, why didn't you answer before?

409
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:25,635
Men? What are you talking about?

410
00:31:26,011 --> 00:31:27,137
Don't you remember?

411
00:31:27,929 --> 00:31:29,139
They wanted to join us.

412
00:31:30,849 --> 00:31:32,017
Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,560
All I did was drink with you.

414
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:35,937
- Hello.
- Hi there.

415
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:38,898
Would it be okay to join you ladies?

416
00:31:40,942 --> 00:31:41,985
So did we join them?

417
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,778
<i>I wouldn't call it that.</i>

418
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:46,906
We were getting our drink on
when Sung-jae stormed in.

419
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:49,659
Sung-jae was there last night?

420
00:31:49,826 --> 00:31:51,911
<i>What? You really blacked out, didn't you?</i>

421
00:31:52,954 --> 00:31:54,039
Did you call him?

422
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:55,790
Are you insane?

423
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,001
What? I thought you had called him.

424
00:31:58,543 --> 00:31:59,544
Me?

425
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,342
- It wasn't me.
<i>- What?</i>

426
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:07,552
<i>Then how did he know we were there?</i>

427
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,056
Do you two track each other?

428
00:32:11,765 --> 00:32:13,016
No, of course not.

429
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,812
But maybe I should have done that.

430
00:32:21,066 --> 00:32:22,150
What? Why?

431
00:32:22,692 --> 00:32:23,693
Is something wrong?

432
00:32:24,527 --> 00:32:25,570
<i>No.</i>

433
00:32:27,781 --> 00:32:28,907
Except that Sung-jae's gone.

434
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,033
He's disappeared.

435
00:32:32,243 --> 00:32:34,496
He skipped a trial
and won't answer his phone.

436
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,290
<i>Sin-hwa.</i>

437
00:32:37,499 --> 00:32:38,708
Do you think Sung-jae

438
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:40,418
thought I was maybe...

439
00:32:41,169 --> 00:32:42,545
I know what you're thinking.

440
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,674
But you were on good behavior,
so don't worry.

441
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,051
He wouldn't ghost you over that.

442
00:33:09,698 --> 00:33:10,824
SUNG-JAE
<i>Where are you?</i>

443
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:12,450
<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

444
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,077
<i>Last night was...</i>

445
00:33:14,869 --> 00:33:15,912
<i>You've got it wrong.</i>

446
00:33:16,246 --> 00:33:17,580
<i>Let's talk in person.</i>

447
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:18,915
<i>Please come home.</i>

448
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,642
Ms. Kim Yoon-sun?

449
00:34:08,923 --> 00:34:10,717
What brings you here at this hour?

450
00:34:11,468 --> 00:34:13,428
I have a message for Mr. Cha.

451
00:34:14,888 --> 00:34:16,306
But he won't return my calls.

452
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,559
Is he still not reachable?

453
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,731
It's late right now.

454
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:26,649
I'll have him contact you in the morning.

455
00:34:26,941 --> 00:34:28,818
- Have him contact Mr. Ma, not me.
- Right.

456
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:30,612
Mr. Ma Kang.

457
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,615
I'll have him call Mr. Ma.

458
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:00,684
<i>The consumer price index</i>
<i>has increased by two percent...</i>

459
00:35:02,227 --> 00:35:04,938
<i>The price of petroleum has plummeted</i>

460
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:06,815
<i>to an all-time low.</i>

461
00:35:07,816 --> 00:35:10,527
<i>The government has announced</i>
<i>plans to ensure</i>

462
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,613
<i>price stability by keeping an eye</i>
<i>on weather conditions</i>

463
00:35:13,822 --> 00:35:16,908
<i>and price and supply demands</i>
<i>and will take swift action if necessary.</i>

464
00:35:18,118 --> 00:35:20,453
<i>Starting tomorrow,</i>
<i>the police force will...</i>

465
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,497
I came by because I was worried.

466
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:23,957
<i>And carry out inspections.</i>

467
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,459
<i>The Korean National Police Agency will</i>

468
00:35:26,543 --> 00:35:28,253
<i>use this opportunity to prevent...</i>

469
00:35:28,336 --> 00:35:29,379
I'm sorry.

470
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:31,256
Has he called you--

471
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:33,258
Have you heard from Sung-jae?

472
00:35:33,341 --> 00:35:35,885
<i>They also stated</i>
<i>their intent to lift the ban.</i>

473
00:35:37,345 --> 00:35:41,725
<i>A dump truck crossed the center line,</i>
<i>causing a multi-car accident in a tunnel.</i>

474
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:46,396
<i>One male driver in his 30s was killed,</i>
<i>while two others were severely injured.</i>

475
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:49,149
<i>There was also a marine accident.</i>

476
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:52,861
<i>A car fell into the ocean</i>
<i>while reversing at the Haejeon docks.</i>

477
00:35:53,278 --> 00:35:55,613
<i>The driver was rescued</i>
<i>by the Korea Coast Guard.</i>

478
00:35:55,905 --> 00:35:59,034
<i>However, he died 12 hours</i>
<i>after arriving at the hospital.</i>

479
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,538
SUNG-JAE

480
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:11,129
SUNG-JAE

481
00:36:20,555 --> 00:36:22,766
<i>The person you have dialed is unavailable.</i>

482
00:36:22,849 --> 00:36:24,100
<i>Please leave a message...</i>

483
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,610
- Hello?
<i>- Attorney Na Moon-young.</i>

484
00:36:34,361 --> 00:36:36,654
<i>This is Ma Kang from Geumsin Development.</i>

485
00:36:37,739 --> 00:36:38,740
Yes, sir.

486
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:40,700
<i>Has Mr. Cha</i>

487
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:42,202
<i>come back home yet?</i>

488
00:36:43,161 --> 00:36:44,454
No, not yet.

489
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:47,791
Ms. Na.

490
00:36:49,167 --> 00:36:50,960
We have to find Mr. Cha quickly.

491
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:53,880
We're in a difficult position, you see.

492
00:36:55,799 --> 00:36:57,509
I understand, sir.

493
00:36:57,926 --> 00:36:59,135
I'll do my best and try--

494
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,762
<i>I don't think you understand.</i>

495
00:37:02,722 --> 00:37:04,766
<i>This isn't the only case that Mr. Cha</i>

496
00:37:04,849 --> 00:37:06,518
<i>was handling for our company.</i>

497
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,187
I see.

498
00:37:10,438 --> 00:37:11,481
Excuse me, sir,

499
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,650
but are you in touch with Ms. Kim?

500
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,277
I thought I saw her
near my house last night,

501
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:17,654
but I can't reach her now.

502
00:37:19,989 --> 00:37:22,158
<i>Ms. Kim was near your house?</i>

503
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:25,787
<i>Find out where Mr. Cha is first.</i>

504
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:36,172
It seems Ms. Kim has other plans in mind.

505
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,759
I'll look into it, sir.

506
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:49,477
MANAGER KO CHUN-HEE

507
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:55,692
Ms. Ko, are you at work?

508
00:37:56,526 --> 00:37:58,611
Did you run the license plate number--

509
00:38:09,414 --> 00:38:10,790
- Oh, no.
- What do we do?

510
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:13,376
Yes, of course.

511
00:38:14,252 --> 00:38:15,837
I'll call the police right now.

512
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:17,630
Come quickly, Ms. Na.

513
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,355
ATTORNEY CHA SUNG-JAE

514
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,856
- In-kyu, call the police.
- Yes?

515
00:38:34,939 --> 00:38:36,149
Right. I'll call them.

516
00:38:42,906 --> 00:38:45,492
There's no end to this.
I'm going to lose it.

517
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:56,920
Anything else?

518
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:01,091
Sir, we pulled this
from the security cameras.

519
00:39:02,050 --> 00:39:03,218
I got it.

520
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,761
Yes, sir.

521
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,269
Mr. Cho?

522
00:39:25,573 --> 00:39:26,908
Hello, Prosecutor Na.

523
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,243
No, wait.

524
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,120
It's Attorney Na now.

525
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:32,370
It's been a while.

526
00:39:31,871 --> 00:39:32,997
So Prosecutor Na...

527
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:34,958
I mean, Attorney Na.

528
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,959
I'm not used to it.

529
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,838
Hello, Inspector Baek.

530
00:39:40,630 --> 00:39:42,632
My gosh. It's a small world.

531
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:44,841
Don't you think?

532
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:48,013
We're not the only former prosecutors
and police officers in Korea,

533
00:39:48,096 --> 00:39:51,057
but we managed
to run into each other in this tiny town.

534
00:39:51,141 --> 00:39:53,685
If you blame me
for receiving disciplinary action,

535
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,395
I'll talk to the other officer

536
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:56,980
to avoid any awkwardness.

537
00:39:57,814 --> 00:39:59,149
Not at all, ma'am.

538
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:00,942
I'm very professional.

539
00:40:01,026 --> 00:40:03,194
I'll conduct a thorough investigation.

540
00:40:03,445 --> 00:40:04,446
Now then.

541
00:40:05,238 --> 00:40:07,907
Do you happen to recognize anyone

542
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:10,660
on this security footage?

543
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:14,998
No, I don't.

544
00:40:19,961 --> 00:40:21,755
So they trashed the office

545
00:40:22,881 --> 00:40:24,132
but didn't take anything.

546
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:28,345
Right. I'll head to the station

547
00:40:29,095 --> 00:40:30,722
and try to identify the suspects.

548
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:32,098
I'll be in touch.

549
00:40:34,267 --> 00:40:35,435
Something is missing.

550
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:39,356
My husband has gone missing.

551
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:41,941
It's been over 24 hours.

552
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,111
Has anyone reported
an unidentified victim?

553
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:50,909
We don't consider adults
who are just off the grid as "missing."

554
00:40:51,743 --> 00:40:53,203
You should still investigate.

555
00:40:54,871 --> 00:40:57,082
Do you have any proof that links this case

556
00:40:57,165 --> 00:40:58,875
to your husband going missing?

557
00:40:59,084 --> 00:41:01,586
I know adults like him
won't be considered missing.

558
00:41:02,504 --> 00:41:04,130
But someone broke in here

559
00:41:04,214 --> 00:41:05,674
right after he went missing.

560
00:41:07,676 --> 00:41:09,219
Isn't this worth investigating?

561
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:10,637
Did you two have a fight?

562
00:41:11,846 --> 00:41:12,889
No.

563
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:16,643
Was there anything unusual
about your husband?

564
00:41:16,726 --> 00:41:18,726
Not at all.

565
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,104
Did he have depression

566
00:41:19,354 --> 00:41:20,647
or suicidal thoughts?

567
00:41:20,814 --> 00:41:21,856
No, not at all.

568
00:41:22,107 --> 00:41:24,442
My husband didn't
play the market or gamble.

569
00:41:24,818 --> 00:41:26,319
No accidents or criminal record.

570
00:41:26,403 --> 00:41:28,113
No illness or warning signs of suicide.

571
00:41:28,571 --> 00:41:30,571
None of that.

572
00:41:30,782 --> 00:41:32,075
He didn't just leave home.

573
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,829
Please check if there's been an accident.

574
00:41:42,961 --> 00:41:44,796
WOOIL BANK BRANCH MANAGER

575
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:54,347
So she's still stubborn as ever

576
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,932
and likes to complicate matters.

577
00:41:58,977 --> 00:42:00,020
Hello, sir.

578
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,194
Loan repayment?

579
00:42:08,445 --> 00:42:09,612
ATTORNEY CHA SUNG-JAE

580
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:39,309
The car you asked about

581
00:42:39,392 --> 00:42:41,311
has nothing to do with Mr. Cha...

582
00:42:43,646 --> 00:42:45,732
Is his digital certificate on his laptop?

583
00:42:45,899 --> 00:42:46,900
Goodness.

584
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:50,528
It's probably on a USB drive.

585
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,197
Do you know which one?

586
00:42:52,864 --> 00:42:53,990
Of course not.

587
00:42:54,074 --> 00:42:55,325
Just try each one.

588
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:56,659
Do you know the passcode?

589
00:42:57,202 --> 00:42:58,328
I'll have to guess.

590
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,497
CHA WOONG LAW FIRM

591
00:43:02,374 --> 00:43:03,416
Where's his seal?

592
00:43:03,541 --> 00:43:05,541
Ms. Na?

593
00:43:05,502 --> 00:43:07,337
He carried his driver's license,

594
00:43:07,754 --> 00:43:09,673
so I think he left his ID card here.

595
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:16,304
Do you have a front and back copy
of Mr. Cha's ID card?

596
00:43:16,554 --> 00:43:18,598
Let's wait and ask him when he comes.

597
00:43:18,682 --> 00:43:19,974
We might go bankrupt.

598
00:43:21,351 --> 00:43:24,396
I'm a managing partner,
but I had no idea what was going on.

599
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:28,274
I knew we were in the hole,

600
00:43:28,358 --> 00:43:30,068
but I didn't know it was this bad.

601
00:43:31,695 --> 00:43:32,987
Did you also not know?

602
00:43:50,714 --> 00:43:52,340
LOAN PRINCIPAL: 3,000,000,000 WON

603
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:53,758
BALANCE: 3,075,000,000 WON

604
00:43:53,967 --> 00:43:57,095
Rent and other payments
have been overdue for a while.

605
00:43:57,929 --> 00:43:59,889
The employees haven't been paid either.

606
00:44:02,267 --> 00:44:03,351
Since when?

607
00:44:04,227 --> 00:44:06,227
Three months ago.

608
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,814
Why didn't you tell me?

609
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:09,816
What did Mr. Cha say?

610
00:44:10,191 --> 00:44:12,152
He said the money was coming
and asked us to wait.

611
00:44:12,235 --> 00:44:13,445
We had no choice.

612
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:16,239
He made us promise not to tell you.

613
00:44:19,367 --> 00:44:20,452
Does Father know?

614
00:44:21,161 --> 00:44:22,245
Of course not!

615
00:44:22,328 --> 00:44:24,414
He trusted his son to run his firm.

616
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:26,750
He's only staying on

617
00:44:26,833 --> 00:44:28,710
as a legal advisor
because of the firm's fame.

618
00:44:29,002 --> 00:44:31,421
He occasionally helps us accept cases,

619
00:44:31,838 --> 00:44:33,923
but he hasn't managed the firm in ages.

620
00:44:36,301 --> 00:44:38,511
He had such high expectations for his son,

621
00:44:38,595 --> 00:44:41,973
so Mr. Cha naturally felt pressure
as the accounting manager.

622
00:44:43,808 --> 00:44:44,809
I understand.

623
00:44:45,769 --> 00:44:46,936
I'm sorry, Ms. Ko.

624
00:44:48,271 --> 00:44:50,106
I'll make sure you get paid first.

625
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:57,989
SIN-HWA

626
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:03,161
<i>I was about to call you.</i>

627
00:45:03,244 --> 00:45:04,287
<i>Is Sung-jae back?</i>

628
00:45:04,454 --> 00:45:05,538
Sin-hwa.

629
00:45:05,622 --> 00:45:06,790
I need your help.

630
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:08,667
Can you track down

631
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,919
Sung-jae's phone and car for me?

632
00:45:13,004 --> 00:45:15,131
It's bad enough
I got demoted and sent here.

633
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,467
Do you want me to lose my job entirely?

634
00:45:18,176 --> 00:45:19,761
<i>I'm not asking for a search team.</i>

635
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:22,138
<i>Just locate him, and I'll do the rest.</i>

636
00:45:22,222 --> 00:45:23,723
You know that's illegal!

637
00:45:23,973 --> 00:45:26,059
<i>The police accepted</i>
<i>the missing person report, right?</i>

638
00:45:28,436 --> 00:45:31,147
They think I'm a wife
looking for her cheating husband.

639
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:34,234
Come on.

640
00:45:35,944 --> 00:45:37,654
Maybe he just hit a rough patch.

641
00:45:37,737 --> 00:45:39,948
It's not easy to run
a well-known law firm.

642
00:45:40,031 --> 00:45:42,659
Is it weird to disappear for a bit
because of stress?

643
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:45,286
Moon-young, are you sure
you're not overreacting?

644
00:45:45,495 --> 00:45:48,498
Have you considered
that maybe he went missing voluntarily?

645
00:45:49,332 --> 00:45:51,332
Hello?

646
00:45:51,292 --> 00:45:52,293
Moon-young!

647
00:45:54,129 --> 00:45:56,214
I've been married, too, you know!

648
00:45:56,297 --> 00:45:58,133
That was your friend, right?

649
00:45:58,675 --> 00:46:00,468
The Cha Woong Foundation Cinderella.

650
00:46:01,803 --> 00:46:02,804
What was that?

651
00:46:03,471 --> 00:46:05,015
Is that what you call her here?

652
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,517
I didn't mean it in a bad way--

653
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:08,810
She's famous, you know.

654
00:46:09,185 --> 00:46:12,355
Everyone knows how they met
when they were young and then got married.

655
00:46:13,606 --> 00:46:15,483
I'll admit Cha Sung-jae is a prince.

656
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,319
But I can't believe you're calling

657
00:46:18,403 --> 00:46:20,030
that vicious thing Cinderella.

658
00:46:20,363 --> 00:46:22,282
Our friends would have
a field day if they knew.

659
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:24,200
Is something wrong, though?

660
00:46:25,035 --> 00:46:27,454
No, she just can't get in touch
with her husband.

661
00:46:27,787 --> 00:46:30,123
The older she gets, the more she worries.

662
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,752
What is it?

663
00:46:38,715 --> 00:46:39,799
The thing is...

664
00:46:53,521 --> 00:46:54,939
MOTHER

665
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:03,573
- Yes, Mother?
<i>- You filed a missing person report?</i>

666
00:47:04,282 --> 00:47:05,909
I did it because this morning--

667
00:47:05,992 --> 00:47:08,370
<i>He's not the type to do anything strange.</i>

668
00:47:08,745 --> 00:47:11,706
<i>He'll be back soon.</i>
<i>Why would you complicate things?</i>

669
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,458
<i>This is how rumors start!</i>

670
00:47:14,084 --> 00:47:16,336
Exactly. He's not that type.
That's why it's strange.

671
00:47:18,129 --> 00:47:20,423
I'm going to find Sung-jae.

672
00:47:21,091 --> 00:47:23,091
Don't worry.

673
00:47:22,509 --> 00:47:23,510
Okay.

674
00:47:31,935 --> 00:47:33,436
PICK UP BOM FROM SCHOOL

675
00:47:37,982 --> 00:47:40,026

NEIGHBOR MS. HA

677
00:47:53,665 --> 00:47:54,749
Hello, Ms. Ha?

678
00:47:56,501 --> 00:47:58,253
I'm sorry to ask you, but...

679
00:48:02,132 --> 00:48:04,884
If I leave now,
I think I'll be right on time.

680
00:48:07,178 --> 00:48:08,471
Don't worry.

681
00:48:08,805 --> 00:48:09,806
Okay.

682
00:48:31,202 --> 00:48:33,038
Darn it. I'm so annoyed.

683
00:48:51,514 --> 00:48:53,514
Bom!

684
00:48:52,849 --> 00:48:54,100
Ms. Ha!

685
00:48:54,642 --> 00:48:56,019
Did your mom call you?

686
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,353
Yes.

687
00:48:57,270 --> 00:48:59,814
Your mom seems really busy today.

688
00:49:00,523 --> 00:49:02,442
I'll bake you some cookies. Shall we?

689
00:49:02,942 --> 00:49:03,943
Yes.

690
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:08,404
Get in.

Ms. Kim?

698
00:50:07,090 --> 00:50:08,633
This is Attorney Na Moon-young.

699
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,010
Ms. Kim?

700
00:50:12,387 --> 00:50:14,387
<i>I'm here.</i>

701
00:50:15,098 --> 00:50:16,808
You just took off yesterday, and...

702
00:50:18,435 --> 00:50:20,270
Did you come to my house last night?

703
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:21,980
Why did you just leave?

704
00:50:22,897 --> 00:50:24,065
Was it because of Mr. Cha?

705
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:25,400
Have you talked to him?

706
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,611
Did you and Mr. Cha...

707
00:50:31,239 --> 00:50:33,283
Hold on. Let's talk in person.

708
00:50:33,658 --> 00:50:36,327
<i>Is Mr. Cha still not back?</i>

709
00:50:36,786 --> 00:50:38,786
That's right.

710
00:50:37,704 --> 00:50:39,789
- So let's meet right now--
<i>- Ms. Na.</i>

711
00:50:39,914 --> 00:50:41,166
<i>Please help me.</i>

712
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:45,754
<i>Meet me under the Haejeon Bridge.</i>

713
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:47,464
<i>There's something you should know.</i>

714
00:50:49,716 --> 00:50:50,884
<i>You have to come alone.</i>

715
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:52,967
<i>If you don't,</i>

716
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,762
<i>I won't trust you.</i>

717
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:24,167
You came to my house last night.

718
00:51:24,918 --> 00:51:26,336
Why did you ask me for help?

719
00:51:27,337 --> 00:51:28,338
Is it true

720
00:51:28,672 --> 00:51:29,964
he hasn't contacted you?

721
00:51:30,298 --> 00:51:32,298
It's true.

722
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:32,467
That's why I'm here.

723
00:51:33,510 --> 00:51:34,678
He ran off, then.

724
00:51:35,845 --> 00:51:36,846
That traitor.

725
00:51:37,055 --> 00:51:38,473
He's trying to save himself.

726
00:51:39,224 --> 00:51:40,725
And he set me up for the fall.

727
00:51:42,352 --> 00:51:44,354
Ms. Kim, what are you talking about?

728
00:51:45,355 --> 00:51:47,355
It wasn't me.

729
00:51:47,315 --> 00:51:49,315
Excuse me?

730
00:51:48,316 --> 00:51:49,526
It wasn't me.

731
00:51:50,026 --> 00:51:51,277
I didn't kill anyone.

732
00:51:51,653 --> 00:51:53,655
I trusted Mr. Cha and took the blame.

733
00:51:53,738 --> 00:51:54,989
But he just disappeared,

734
00:51:55,073 --> 00:51:57,200
so who can I trust
to get me through trial?

735
00:51:57,534 --> 00:51:59,703
I said it wasn't me
and that I didn't want to do it.

736
00:52:00,036 --> 00:52:01,371
I told him that!

737
00:52:02,038 --> 00:52:03,623
Ms. Kim, what do you mean--

738
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:04,833
I just did

739
00:52:05,542 --> 00:52:07,377
as Mr. Ma told me.

740
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,714
He said I just had to follow
Mr. Cha's orders.

741
00:52:12,173 --> 00:52:13,550
Why did I listen to him?

742
00:52:16,886 --> 00:52:18,471
Mr. Cha gave you orders

743
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:20,223
to take the fall?

744
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:22,851
What about the witness?

745
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,560
Do Jin-woo.

746
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:29,607
I should've caught on
when he was brought on as a witness.

747
00:52:30,775 --> 00:52:32,902
He's someone you can just use and discard.

748
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:42,410
What the hell?

749
00:52:41,411 --> 00:52:42,746
I thought you came alone!

750
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,000
What? But I--

751
00:52:48,001 --> 00:52:49,377
Why is that bastard here?

752
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:50,962
Did you call him?

753
00:52:51,129 --> 00:52:53,882
- No, I--
- I just need to take the fall, right?

754
00:52:55,050 --> 00:52:57,050
Ms. Kim!

755
00:53:35,507 --> 00:53:36,716
<i>Please help me.</i>

756
00:53:37,509 --> 00:53:38,968
<i>Why is that bastard here?</i>

757
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,054
<i>I just need to take the fall, right?</i>

758
00:54:07,122 --> 00:54:08,123
Mr. Do Jin-woo?

759
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:19,592
Who were you following?

760
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:22,260
Me?

761
00:54:21,386 --> 00:54:23,386
Or Ms. Kim?

762
00:54:25,181 --> 00:54:27,181
Mr. Do.

763
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,018
You were going to commit perjury.

764
00:54:28,685 --> 00:54:30,186
Don't you know that's a crime?

765
00:54:35,483 --> 00:54:37,110
There's nothing funny about this.

766
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:40,947
You don't know anything.
You should be afraid.

767
00:54:41,197 --> 00:54:43,197
You're right.

768
00:54:42,365 --> 00:54:43,700
I don't know anything.

769
00:54:44,492 --> 00:54:45,952
So tell me already!

770
00:54:47,203 --> 00:54:48,204
That's something...

771
00:54:56,755 --> 00:54:58,923
you should ask your husband.

775
00:55:22,447 --> 00:55:23,615
Yes. What's this about?

776
00:55:24,324 --> 00:55:26,951
<i>You filed a missing person report</i>
<i>on Mr. Cha, correct?</i>

777
00:55:27,994 --> 00:55:29,994
Yes.

778
00:55:29,162 --> 00:55:30,163
Have you found him?

779
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:34,417
<i>We found his ID card</i>

Did you hurt yourself?

783
00:57:49,386 --> 00:57:51,096
Oh, I nicked myself cutting fruit.

784
00:58:18,957 --> 00:58:20,166
It goes well with your outfit.

785
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:28,089
See you later.

<i>It's not suicide.</i>

787
00:59:04,961 --> 00:59:06,087
<i>He wouldn't do that.</i>

788
00:59:07,047 --> 00:59:08,089
<i>I'll find out</i>

789
00:59:08,173 --> 00:59:10,633
<i>what happened to my husband.</i>

790
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:13,636
<i>Sung-jae was going to file</i>
<i>for the firm's bankruptcy.</i>

791
00:59:13,803 --> 00:59:15,803
<i>The problem is,</i>

792
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,514
<i>it wasn't just corporate debt.</i>

793
00:59:16,890 --> 00:59:20,185
<i>Are you saying Sung-jae</i>
<i>was involved in something illegal?</i>

794
00:59:20,518 --> 00:59:21,811
<i>Did you kill her, Mr. Do?</i>

795
00:59:21,895 --> 00:59:23,855
<i>You'd perjure yourself for money.</i>

796
00:59:23,938 --> 00:59:26,191
So I wouldn't put it past you
to kill someone.

797
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:27,609
<i>Did Mr. Ma order you?</i>

798
