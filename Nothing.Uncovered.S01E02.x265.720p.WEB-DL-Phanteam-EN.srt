1
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:11,709
(All locations, characters,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:13,310
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:18,180
(Episode 2)

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,850
(Go to Unit 1401 at Leaders Palace
for your appointment at 7:20 p.m.)

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:36,770
(Except for the underground
parking lot and the main entrance,)

6
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,200
(security cameras will be installed
upon completion of the interior finish.)

7
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,660
The door is closing.

8
00:02:10,260 --> 00:02:11,329
I don't believe this.

9
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,260
Hey.

10
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:16,870
Ms. Cha Eun Sae.

11
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,450
(Chief Kang In Han)

12
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:42,089
Swear your loyalty to me
three times.

13
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,290
- Pardon me?
- I met with the CEO...

14
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,760
and recommended you as Anchor Lee's
successor for the nine o'clock news.

15
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:51,100
Until the CEO finalizes his decision
and picks you,

16
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:53,040
you'd better stay out of trouble.
Do you understand?

17
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,119
Are you listening?

18
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:08,549
Why are you all quiet?
Don't be such a downer.

19
00:03:14,389 --> 00:03:15,859
Hey, what's with the sirens?

20
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,790
Where are you?

21
00:03:26,839 --> 00:03:28,040
I'll call you later.

22
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
My gosh.

23
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,510
I'm so glad I ran into you here.

24
00:04:10,179 --> 00:04:13,419
It's Unit 1201.
I sent you the wrong unit number.

25
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,250
I'm sorry. Did you go up
to the 14th floor?

26
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,250
Yes.

27
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:21,959
The corridor was all dark,
so I came right down.

28
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:23,630
I came here hoping to find you.

29
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,889
I tried calling you,
but you didn't pick up.

30
00:04:27,329 --> 00:04:28,829
I didn't know you called.

31
00:04:29,459 --> 00:04:30,469
Shall we?

32
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,550
Jung Won?

33
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,620
Jung Won.

34
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,420
Yes.

35
00:04:53,389 --> 00:04:56,229
Why do you think
you suddenly experienced hyperventilation?

36
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,959
Were you under a lot of stress
or angry about something recently?

37
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,229
Or did you experience
some kind of emotional shock?

38
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,430
What exactly happened?

39
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,839
I got into an argument
with an informant.

40
00:05:20,519 --> 00:05:22,019
Do you think...

41
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:24,820
you were overly agitated?

42
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:29,760
Stay calm.

43
00:05:30,659 --> 00:05:31,789
I'm sure she didn't see it.

44
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:35,430
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

45
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,769
I was quite agitated earlier,

46
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:47,010
but I've calmed down
now that I'm here.

47
00:05:47,909 --> 00:05:50,010
That tells me how much you trust me.

48
00:05:51,709 --> 00:05:53,550
And that's why I care about you more
than my other patients.

49
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:10,870
(Security cameras
will be installed...)

50
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,899
(upon completion of the interior finish.)

51
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:28,180
No cameras in the elevator
or in the corridor on the 14th floor.

52
00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:30,149
They won't find me in the footage.

53
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,360
(We welcome our new residents.)

54
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:50,570
The sirens...

55
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,180
had nothing to do with Cha Eun Sae,
after all.

56
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:37,589
What was I thinking, coming home
like this? Why did I run away?

57
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,789
Jung Won, are you in there?

58
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:55,870
I'm sorry.

59
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,709
I was stressed out,
so I drank quite a bit.

60
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:02,979
Stressed out? About what?

61
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,349
The truth is...

62
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,459
For the past few days,

63
00:08:15,389 --> 00:08:17,260
I haven't been able to write at all.

64
00:08:25,829 --> 00:08:28,170
I'm so frustrated.

65
00:08:56,629 --> 00:08:58,300
- A murder?
- Yes.

66
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,499
Of a celebrity.

67
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,489
We barely got started
on the Jin Myung Sook case.

68
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,890
It'll be a headache.

69
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:22,060
Killers don't act
depending on our schedule.

70
00:09:22,219 --> 00:09:25,229
Just like Jin, Cha was stabbed
multiple times in the stomach.

71
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,300
A lethal blow.

72
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,599
- Murder weapon?
- None.

73
00:09:33,599 --> 00:09:34,969
Her wallet and phone are gone too.

74
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,050
- Did you photograph this?
- No.

75
00:09:46,209 --> 00:09:47,219
Do it now.

76
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,859
- It's snapped.
- Could it belong to the killer?

77
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,359
Did it break in the scuffle?

78
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:02,930
Or it could be hers.

79
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,770
What is this place?

80
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,609
Cha Eun Sae's personal agency.

81
00:10:11,869 --> 00:10:13,140
They were preparing to open.

82
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:29,859
What is this?

83
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:31,790
Why is it just like that time?

84
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,829
You mean the clock
at Jin Myung Sook's crime scene?

85
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,729
I wondered what it meant too.

86
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:39,770
Most of the stuff here doesn't work.

87
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:42,900
Who found her?

88
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,410
Two men who came to do the interior.

89
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:46,979
Tae Heon. The building's interior
isn't complete yet...

90
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:48,509
I know.
Get footage from the cameras...

91
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:50,609
at the main entrance
and basement parking level.

92
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:52,609
Okay.

93
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,579
Here you go.

94
00:10:56,249 --> 00:10:58,150
The other cameras
including the ones...

95
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,920
at the back
were going to be installed today.

96
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Why did this
have to happen yesterday?

97
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,089
Don't ask why.

98
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,430
It had to be yesterday.

99
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,009
It was the ideal opportunity
to do it without being filmed.

100
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:21,839
The killer would've planned
the murder taking into account...

101
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,950
the day the cameras
would be installed.

102
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:29,920
Either they obtained information
that Cha would be at the office.

103
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,859
Or they lured her there on purpose.

104
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:38,930
It's one or the other.

105
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,900
They stabbed her many times,
viciously, facing her.

106
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,869
So they could watch her suffer.

107
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:50,310
It was someone with a grudge?

108
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,810
What could that be?

109
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:54,509
Money? Love? Revenge?

110
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,390
(Cha Eun Sae)

111
00:12:09,089 --> 00:12:10,329
(Cha, beautiful in white)

112
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,060
Darling.

113
00:12:16,999 --> 00:12:18,129
You startled me.

114
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:19,300
Sorry.

115
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,940
All this.

116
00:12:22,739 --> 00:12:25,239
Did you prepare it to celebrate
the anniversary of my first novel?

117
00:12:25,469 --> 00:12:27,509
I had no idea.

118
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,479
Sorry for coming home
late and drunk.

119
00:12:29,979 --> 00:12:32,709
With whom and where
did you drink last night?

120
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,180
Alone, in my studio.

121
00:12:45,129 --> 00:12:46,259
I'm sorry.

122
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:53,999
I have bad news.

123
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,440
It's crazy.

124
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:00,339
- Cha Eun Sae is dead!
- What?

125
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,209
What tabloid did you get that from?

126
00:13:03,209 --> 00:13:05,579
- Why would she die?
- It's a fact.

127
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:07,820
The newsflash will come on
in five minutes.

128
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,320
This just in. At around 5 a.m. on the 7th,

129
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,190
at her agency office in Gangha-gu,

130
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,520
actress Cha Eun Sae was found dead.

131
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,930
Interior laborers found her
and called the police.

132
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,359
The police suppose it's a murder,

133
00:13:21,359 --> 00:13:23,969
and are working on the cause of death.

134
00:13:24,469 --> 00:13:26,369
Regarding the news,

135
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,940
her agency announced
nothing is official yet,

136
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,910
and so that the deceased
can rest in peace,

137
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:34,009
- they asked the media not to...
- I was right.

138
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,280
What was she like when you saw her?

139
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:40,979
Urgent. Contact me immediately.

140
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,619
It means she died
the day after you met her.

141
00:13:46,619 --> 00:13:47,690
Right?

142
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,129
Gosh. You must feel horrible.

143
00:13:54,329 --> 00:13:56,999
- Hello?
- You met Cha Eun Sae two days ago?

144
00:13:56,999 --> 00:13:58,229
Come to my office now.

145
00:14:00,969 --> 00:14:04,270
She gave you no information at all?

146
00:14:04,869 --> 00:14:07,540
You said she wanted to meet
to give you a tip-off.

147
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:08,979
There's really nothing?

148
00:14:08,979 --> 00:14:10,209
It was a prank.

149
00:14:10,509 --> 00:14:12,009
She needed someone to talk to.

150
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,349
I thought we had a scoop.

151
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:18,390
But then, her murder is a scoop.

152
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,020
Work on something...

153
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,690
that'll get us
the highest rating ever.

154
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:24,129
It might be your last show.

155
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:27,430
They got a one-month replacement...

156
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,900
for the nine o'clock news presenter.

157
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,599
They'll announce the next
permanent presenter next month.

158
00:14:30,599 --> 00:14:33,800
You want to use this chance
to appeal to the big boss.

159
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,140
Don't you?

160
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,239
If it's too much for you,

161
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:39,739
I'll give the job to Ji Ho.

162
00:14:41,609 --> 00:14:44,310
I'll work on the Cha murder
after the marriage con story.

163
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,349
Leave it alone.

164
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,300
(Main entrance 01F-01,
Basement 02F-03)

165
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:10,070
Are you sure these are
the only cameras that were working?

166
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,209
Yes.

167
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:18,509
(Zeus)

168
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:22,650
(Security,
Restricted Area, Staff Only)

169
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,119
What?
Is it about Cha Eun Sae's death?

170
00:15:25,119 --> 00:15:28,690
Yes. I want the visitor list
for Leaders Palace yesterday.

171
00:15:28,690 --> 00:15:30,589
The cameras have
too many blind spots.

172
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:32,430
Collect all the phone GPS signals.

173
00:15:34,459 --> 00:15:37,700
(National Forensic Service)

174
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,099
- It was murder, right?
- Yes.

175
00:15:42,099 --> 00:15:43,940
There are slight defense wounds
on her arm.

176
00:15:45,009 --> 00:15:48,009
Dead by excessive bleeding
from a ruptured abdominal aorta.

177
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,239
Estimated time of death...

178
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,650
is between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on October 6.

179
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,020
Same cause of death
as Jin Myung Sook?

180
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,820
If you're stabbed
in the stomach with something,

181
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,820
it usually causes
excessive bleeding.

182
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,229
What's the width?

183
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:06,629
Based on the length,

184
00:16:06,629 --> 00:16:09,729
the knife wasn't much bigger
than a fruit knife.

185
00:16:12,129 --> 00:16:13,940
That's identical
to the Jin case too.

186
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,040
How many wounds were there?

187
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,940
You said Jin was stabbed again
in the same spot.

188
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:22,839
Now that you mention it,
that's identical as well.

189
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,910
The killer stabbed Cha
in the same spot again too?

190
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,050
Are the two cases connected?

191
00:16:31,050 --> 00:16:33,050
No.

192
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:34,560
How could a housekeeper's
and a celebrity's deaths be connected?

193
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,320
Two murders in a row...

194
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,459
got him more sensitive
than my wife with three kids.

195
00:16:39,459 --> 00:16:41,030
You know I'm sensitive.

196
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:43,800
Why haven't you brought me
Jin's bank statements yet?

197
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,129
Sorry.
I'll get them for you right away.

198
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,869
Shall I tell you something shocking?

199
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:55,209
Did you find drugs?

200
00:16:55,209 --> 00:16:56,879
She was three months pregnant.

201
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:58,910
Cha Eun Sae.

202
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,320
What?

203
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:16,029
It has to be
a grudge plus love combo.

204
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,130
Get Cha's medical records
and call history.

205
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,170
Got it.

206
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:34,180
Hey, my baby called.

207
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,749
We'll issue a statement soon.

208
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,390
I know a little about the scene.

209
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:43,930
I just need a yes-or-no answer
to check some facts.

210
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:46,130
You have five minutes.

211
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:49,729
I heard Cha
was stabbed in the stomach.

212
00:17:49,729 --> 00:17:51,069
So she was murdered, right?

213
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:53,739
What's the estimated time of death?

214
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:56,239
Between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. on October 6.

215
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,640
Did you find anything crucial...

216
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,140
at the scene
like a weapon or prints?

217
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,709
Do you have a suspect?
Have you identified someone?

218
00:18:04,809 --> 00:18:06,450
The body was found at dawn today.

219
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,319
How could we have a suspect already?

220
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,120
I heard something off the record.

221
00:18:12,850 --> 00:18:13,890
Was Cha Eun Sae...

222
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,019
really pregnant?

223
00:18:18,090 --> 00:18:19,190
Who told you that?

224
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:22,700
Thanks for your cooperation.

225
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,400
Wait. Who told you?

226
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,200
I gave you something
and I want something back.

227
00:18:26,499 --> 00:18:28,400
How could a reporter know
unless I got a tip-off?

228
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,690
I love your husband.

229
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:47,860
And your husband loves me back.

230
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,140
Welcome home.

231
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:02,840
You must be hungry.

232
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,309
I'm almost done.

233
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,950
I'm sorry.

234
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,150
I won't drink like that again.
Don't be mad. Please?

235
00:19:19,219 --> 00:19:20,289
Cha Eun Sae...

236
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,190
Did you read the article
about her murder?

237
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:25,259
Yes.

238
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,870
Cha Eun Sae gave this to me.

239
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,979
The day before she died,
she called me. So we met.

240
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,180
Here's what she told me.

241
00:19:46,749 --> 00:19:48,650
That you and Cha Eun Sae
were in love.

242
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,719
She asked me to divorce you.

243
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,759
- What?
- Was she telling the truth?

244
00:19:58,759 --> 00:19:59,830
Cha Eun Sae...

245
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,400
said that?

246
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:06,330
She must have told me that
for a reason.

247
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,170
Did you...

248
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,870
cheat on me with her?

249
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:21,479
Hold on.

250
00:20:43,269 --> 00:20:44,569
Cha Eun Sae gave this to me.

251
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,410
(Congratulations
on publishing your novel.)

252
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,410
(I'd like to give this present
in person, but...)

253
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:52,549
I met her once last year...

254
00:20:52,549 --> 00:20:54,549
at my publishing house's
get-together.

255
00:20:53,549 --> 00:20:54,580
(So I'm sending it to you via courier.
From Cha Eun Sae)

256
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,850
She was offered to publish an essay.

257
00:20:56,249 --> 00:20:58,019
Afterward, she asked around
to get my phone number.

258
00:20:58,350 --> 00:20:59,819
She texted me she was lonely
and asked me to buy her a drink.

259
00:20:59,819 --> 00:21:01,289
She hit on me
which made me uncomfortable.

260
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,120
When I published my book,

261
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,360
she sent me cologne and this card
to my publishing house.

262
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:06,860
A few days ago,

263
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,600
I cleaned my study.
That's when I found it.

264
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:14,569
Cha Eun Sae thought you were in love
when you met only once last year?

265
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,140
I blocked her number...

266
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,610
because she kept calling me
like a nuisance.

267
00:21:21,979 --> 00:21:23,110
This is her number.

268
00:21:23,779 --> 00:21:25,509
(Block numbers, unblock)

269
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,380
I couldn't tell you
because I didn't want you to worry.

270
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,450
That was over a year ago.

271
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,920
I can't believe
she said such nonsense to you.

272
00:21:32,549 --> 00:21:34,090
I'm so shocked that I'm speechless.

273
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,559
You...

274
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:40,660
really didn't cheat on me with her?

275
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:42,799
I showed you everything.

276
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,729
I explained what happened.
But are you still suspecting me?

277
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,370
She gave me her sonogram.
How could I not suspect you?

278
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:50,440
Jung Won.

279
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:53,870
How could you believe that...

280
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:54,809
I cheated on you with another woman
and knocked her up at that too?

281
00:21:54,809 --> 00:21:55,910
If that wasn't true,

282
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,950
why would Cha Eun Sae say
that you did?

283
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:59,749
That's what I would like to ask her!

284
00:22:00,209 --> 00:22:01,880
If she wasn't dead,

285
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:06,120
I would like to ask her
why she said such a crazy thing...

286
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,489
like that.
It's me who wants to confront her.

287
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:16,860
I don't know...

288
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:21,269
what more I can do to prove to you
that what she said isn't true.

289
00:22:21,370 --> 00:22:23,940
What should I do? You tell me.

290
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,170
Yesterday afternoon,

291
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:29,180
why did you go
to the marriage counseling clinic?

292
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:31,380
Did you follow me?

293
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,650
Why did you go to the clinic?

294
00:22:35,719 --> 00:22:37,319
I went to see a psychiatrist
for depression.

295
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,450
I was told
my loneliness was the cause.

296
00:22:43,819 --> 00:22:45,630
My psychiatrist said
I needed to be treated,

297
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:46,860
so I've been seeing my psychiatrist
for a month.

298
00:22:50,259 --> 00:22:52,299
Admitting that...

299
00:22:52,630 --> 00:22:55,499
I am a weak human being
is embarrassing,

300
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:59,539
and I hate it too.

301
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:19,930
Oh, that necklace.
It's from Herzeus, right?

302
00:23:20,330 --> 00:23:21,529
It's so pretty.

303
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,529
My husband got it for me.

304
00:23:23,529 --> 00:23:24,600
We're in a relationship.

305
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:27,029
He bought this necklace for me too.

306
00:23:29,739 --> 00:23:33,140
She even lied about the necklace
because she was obsessed with him.

307
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:03,700
What are you looking for?

308
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:06,140
I can't find the necklace
you bought for me.

309
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,309
You thought
you had lost the bracelet...

310
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,450
I bought for you,
but it was in your office.

311
00:24:15,819 --> 00:24:17,390
I should look for it
once I go to work.

312
00:24:19,350 --> 00:24:21,420
I made the vegetable juice for you.
Drink it before you go.

313
00:24:24,390 --> 00:24:25,430
It's my fault.

314
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,729
I didn't know that
you were that lonely.

315
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:34,969
I had been too inattentive.

316
00:24:36,239 --> 00:24:37,640
I know it won't be easy,

317
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:41,080
but I'll try my best to make time
for you from now on.

318
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:43,910
It's not your fault.

319
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,650
It's all
because I'm pathetic and weak.

320
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,920
Don't say that.

321
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,150
You're making me feel sorrier
about this.

322
00:24:56,259 --> 00:24:58,390
Of course, you ought to be sorry.

323
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,489
Do you know how much it cost
to buy that necklace?

324
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,999

- I got it.

327
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,809
This isn't your home.
You should learn to knock.

328
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,809
I have nothing to say to a thief
who stole my project.

329
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,950
You said
you had a lot on your plate.

330
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,380
I heard that you couldn't even start
investigating Cha Eun Sae's case.

331
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,749
I obtained confidential information
about her case. So choose.

332
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,719
Is it me or him?

333
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,489
Should I leave?

334
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,200
Get out.

335
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,840
- What?
- Out.

336
00:26:41,459 --> 00:26:43,529
What's this confidential information
about her case?

337
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:48,600
Cha Eun Sae was pregnant.

338
00:26:49,469 --> 00:26:51,340
Gosh. Really?

339
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:53,809
Once this gets out,

340
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,309
it will go down in history
as the most shocking scoop.

341
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,640
I told you to leave it alone.

342
00:26:56,809 --> 00:26:58,650
If you keep testing the waters,
I won't let it slide.

343
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,690
Then we'll begin.

344
00:27:08,719 --> 00:27:12,330
How did you meet your husband?
Tell us how you two got married.

345
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,860
We met at a club event.

346
00:27:20,299 --> 00:27:22,600
I was attracted to him
because he was sweet and kind.

347
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,209
Until that incident took place
after we got married,

348
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,180
he was the perfect husband.

349
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,450
Let me give you a piggyback ride.

350
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,920
You look gorgeous.

351

It's Seo Jung Won.

352
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,660
When he was taking a shower,
I heard a phone vibrate.

353
00:27:46,229 --> 00:27:48,459
Your phone's ringing.
I hear it vibrating.

354
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:49,529
It's not mine.

355
00:27:50,330 --> 00:27:53,630
I found his second phone in his bag.
Then I figured out everything.

356
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:57,069
Oh, it must be
our upstairs neighbor's phone.

357
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:58,940
I heard it a few days ago too.

358
00:27:59,739 --> 00:28:03,080
That his name
and his family were all fake.

359
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:10,719
It's infuriating that of all people,
I was betrayed by my own husband.

360
00:28:12,519 --> 00:28:14,219
I can neither trust...

361
00:28:15,219 --> 00:28:17,019
nor meet anyone now.

362
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:23,630

by bravely reporting this to us.

367
00:28:38,779 --> 00:28:40,749
from his sister's funeral?
But you know what?

368
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:44,549
I want more people to see this.

369
00:28:44,549 --> 00:28:45,989
I believe it's my duty.

370
00:28:45,989 --> 00:28:48,789
That's how I feel as her brother,
so I hope you all understand. Yes.

371
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:51,029
It'd be nice if you could subscribe
to my channel and like the video.

372
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,390
- Yes.
- Could you stop that for a moment?

373
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:55,729
I have to greet a guest.
One moment, guys.

Yes, I am.

378
00:29:06,309 --> 00:29:08,440
Could you visit the police station
after the funeral?

379
00:29:09,009 --> 00:29:10,580
We need to interview you
as one of the witnesses.

380
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,009
As a witness?

381
00:29:12,509 --> 00:29:14,450
Sure. If you need me, I'll be there.

382

You probably know the passcode
for the door at Cha Eun Sae's place.

It looks like
I have to work late again today.

384

Hey, why are you getting mad at me?

385
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:25,430
Okay, all right.

386
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,100
I hope you were waiting for me
with the footage from the parking lot...

387
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,700
and the vehicle entry
and exit records.

388
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,959
There was nothing important.

389
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:32,569
Cha's manager and her brother
were the only visitors.

390
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,440
Then I guess her boyfriend
didn't bring his car...

391
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,999
or gave a different unit number
if he visited her.

392
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:38,370
What about the analysis
on the necklace?

393
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,069
The only thing they found
was Cha Eun Sae's blood.

394
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:41,539
They can tell that
it's an expensive necklace,

395
00:29:41,539 --> 00:29:43,840
but there was no pendant,
so it'll take some time.

396
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:48,450
Anyway, why are you wearing a suit?
Did you have a blind date?

I hear Cha Eun Sae's brother is
an attention-seeking YouTuber.

409
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,279
Do you think she bought this
to eat it by herself?

for her?

If you see this, I bet...

418

you'll be surprised
as if you've seen a ghost.

424
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,150
That his name
and his family were all fake.

425

He took out loans using the phone

00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,090
I picked it up.

448
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:52,489
Why didn't you tell me you went
to her place to hang out with her?

449
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:53,890
I didn't go there to hang out.

450
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:55,860
She called me there
saying she had a tip-off.

451
00:33:56,059 --> 00:33:57,900
So, she had your number.

452
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,930
No, she said
she'd asked her manager...

453
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:01,469
to get my number.

454
00:34:01,469 --> 00:34:03,400
So, she called you
for the first time that day,

455
00:34:03,969 --> 00:34:05,309
and you met her for the first time?

456
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:08,709
She'd never called me before,
but it was my second time meeting her.

457

I had met her once
about a month ago.

458
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,080
What was the tip-off about?

459
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:21,020
It was a joke. She said
she just wanted to befriend me.

460
00:34:21,319 --> 00:34:22,660
I was expecting a big scoop.

461
00:34:23,319 --> 00:34:24,589
I was baffled.

462
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,100
When we were checking the facts
about Cha Eun Sae's case,

463
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,700
shouldn't you have told me
that you saw her the day before?

464
00:34:31,259 --> 00:34:34,899
It was nothing important,
so I didn't feel the need to tell you.

465
00:34:35,569 --> 00:34:36,799
No more questions, right?

466
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,109
I'm just getting started.

467
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:51,919
The envelope Cha Eun Sae gave you.

468
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:54,719
What was in that envelope?

469
00:34:56,589 --> 00:34:58,489
What did you say to her...

470
00:34:58,489 --> 00:34:59,790
that she slapped you in the face?

471
00:35:01,259 --> 00:35:02,799
According to the time stamps
in the security footage,

472
00:35:03,129 --> 00:35:05,000
as soon as you left
Cha Eun Sae's place,

473
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,669
you came straight
to the police station.

474
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,899
When I took you home,

475
00:35:10,899 --> 00:35:12,339
you burst into tears in my car.

476
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,910
You cried because of what happened
between you and Cha Eun Sae, right?

477
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,649
- No.
- Then answer my question.

478
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:22,950
What was in that envelope?

479
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:24,350
And why did she slap you?

480
00:35:28,189 --> 00:35:29,560
It's a personal matter,

481
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:32,089
so I'm not obligated
to answer your questions.

482
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:37,859
At 7:30 p.m. on October 6,

483
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,430
why were you at Leaders Palace?

484
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,310
You must answer this question...

485
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:47,210
for this concerns your alibi.

486
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:56,779
I had an appointment
at You and Me Neuropsychiatric Clinic.

487
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:59,919
Check with them if you don't believe me.
Are we good now?

488
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,790
Are you going to keep me here
and interrogate me?

489
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,489
Detective Kim Tae Heon.

490
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:11,129
Don't you think you're standing
too close to me right now?

491
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:48,600
We only found five books
at Cha Eun Sae's place,

492
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,540
and they were all novels
by Mr. Seol Woo Jae.

493
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:58,580
The fierce Seo Jung Won
was invited to an actress' place...

494
00:36:58,580 --> 00:36:59,649
and saw something.

495
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:01,410
She was slapped in the face
and cried.

496
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:04,279
Was something going on
between her and your husband?

497
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:06,350
Like...

498
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,020
an affair?

499
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,560
I don't need to answer
such an absurd question.

500
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,129
If this "absurd" speculation
turns out to be true,

501
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:17,259
- shall I tell you?
- Hey, watch what you say.

502
00:37:19,399 --> 00:37:20,500
You said yourself...

503
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,770
that we should always
address each other politely.

504
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,770
Do you now want to talk casually
when we're alone?

505
00:37:27,569 --> 00:37:29,080
Why?
Can you not stand the fact that I,

506
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,310
of all people,
am interrogating you like this?

507
00:37:39,649 --> 00:37:40,719
Ms. Seo Jung Won!

508
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,890
I'm returning this
a little too late.

(Gangha Police Station)

511
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:11,379
You got everything already.
Do you have more questions?

512
00:38:11,379 --> 00:38:12,950
Give me your number.

513
00:38:14,919 --> 00:38:16,189
So you can bother me?

514
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,819
That's how people get closer.

515
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,390
I'll put it in for you.

516
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,660
I left my phone in my car.

517
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:28,339
Write it down.

518
00:38:29,770 --> 00:38:31,439
(Seo Jung Won)

519
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,680
- You're single, right?
- I am,

520
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:45,950
but I'm offended.

521
00:38:47,049 --> 00:38:48,149
I'm pleased.

522
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,919
I'm single too.

523
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:55,600
Don't you think...

524
00:38:58,270 --> 00:38:59,629
we'll end up dating?

525

Did you have a bad dream?

531
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,629
You were okay for a while.

532
00:41:12,399 --> 00:41:13,430
What's that for?

533
00:41:15,469 --> 00:41:17,469
What?

534
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:18,770
I told you I'm giving a talk...

535
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:22,810
on Jeju Island,
so I'd be going away for two days.

536
00:41:33,689 --> 00:41:34,750
Hello, Father.

537
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,160
Sure.

538
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,589
He wants to meet for breakfast.

539
00:42:10,359 --> 00:42:13,029
Long time no see, Ms. Seo.

540
00:42:14,259 --> 00:42:17,660
Are you still upset
she uncovered you last time?

541
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,000
Not at all.

542
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:21,629
Thanks to her,

543
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:24,669
I got some sense knocked into me.

544
00:42:25,969 --> 00:42:28,680
I heard you never apologized.

545
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,379
I know viewer ratings are important,

546
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:35,779
but attacking someone viciously
is never a good sight.

547
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:39,890
You should apologize
for being out of line.

548
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:43,390
Father.

549
00:42:43,989 --> 00:42:47,460
If you demand an apology
in a setting like this...

550
00:42:51,430 --> 00:42:52,629
It's a shame...

551
00:42:53,129 --> 00:42:55,140
my show uncovered your shortcoming,

552
00:42:55,399 --> 00:42:56,640
but I'm not apologetic.

553
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:01,069
I care more about the viewers' right
to know than my ratings.

554
00:43:01,939 --> 00:43:03,939
If I were to grovel
as if I did wrong,

555
00:43:04,939 --> 00:43:06,779
wouldn't that be
more of a disgrace, Father?

556
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:19,989
You're really something. Feisty.

557
00:43:20,489 --> 00:43:24,060
Seo Sang Gyeon
was a lot like this too.

558
00:43:27,569 --> 00:43:31,069
How do you know her late father?

559
00:43:32,239 --> 00:43:35,109
We met a few times
when I was a prosecutor.

560
00:43:37,580 --> 00:43:40,149
You're a lot like him.

561
00:43:50,259 --> 00:43:51,290
I'll see you again.

562
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:00,129
Goodbye, Father.

563
00:44:20,049 --> 00:44:21,390
Give me a moment. Sorry.

564
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,560
Hello.

565
00:44:26,529 --> 00:44:27,830
My late father...

566
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:31,129
Ms. Seo. Are you happy these days?

567
00:44:32,899 --> 00:44:33,930
Yes.

568
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,569
You don't seem so at all.

569
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,710
I think you married the wrong guy.

570
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:45,310
Why do you think so?

571
00:44:46,549 --> 00:44:48,549
It's just...

572
00:44:49,149 --> 00:44:50,180
a hunch.

573
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,359
Sorry.

574
00:45:05,469 --> 00:45:07,069
Yes. That's fine.

575
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:15,310
Sir. It's Kim Tae Heon,
the detective.

576

Hello, it's Kim Tae Heon.

577
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,149
I asked Mr. Song to put me through,

578
00:45:22,149 --> 00:45:23,580
and he told me to call at 1 p.m.

579
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,890
Is this about
my housekeeper's death?

580
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,689
Yes. We took a look...

581
00:45:27,919 --> 00:45:30,489
at her bank statements
and transactions.

582
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:32,390
The day after she got paid,

583
00:45:32,390 --> 00:45:35,129
she withdrew most of the money,
which is quite odd.

584
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,629
Did she? Was she in debt?

585
00:45:37,730 --> 00:45:38,830
No, she wasn't.

586
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:43,000
Did she tell you anything about
what it was for,

587
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:45,839
or did she ask you for a loan?

588
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,339
No, she didn't.

589
00:45:49,009 --> 00:45:51,009
What did she spend that on?

590
00:45:51,339 --> 00:45:53,379
We're stuck
because she knew very few people.

591
00:45:53,910 --> 00:45:55,549
Please ask your daughter.

592
00:45:55,649 --> 00:45:57,649
I will.

593
00:45:58,379 --> 00:46:01,319
How dare he tell me what to do?

594
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:03,489
How frustrating.

595
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,730
There's no call history,

596
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:07,460
and she withdrew most of her pay.

597
00:46:07,759 --> 00:46:11,859
Where do you think Jin spent
all her hard-earned money?

598
00:46:13,569 --> 00:46:14,629
Was she gambling?

599
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,939
Or was she paying off a blackmailer?

601
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,710
Do you remember how he reacted
when we showed him...

602
00:46:25,109 --> 00:46:26,450
Jin's scrapbook of his articles?

603
00:46:28,750 --> 00:46:32,890

collected articles about you?

606
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,460
Why did she collect stuff about me?

607

or did he pretend not to know?

If he's hiding something,

609
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:50,169
is it that they're
getting up to no good in secret?

on the day of the incident?

645
00:49:04,770 --> 00:49:05,870
No.

646
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:09,140
She told me not to visit her.
She even made a ruckus about it.

647
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,839
So I've been to her office...

648
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:13,250
only once.

649
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:18,549
But I did use
the first-floor restroom that day.

650
00:49:18,819 --> 00:49:20,350
Riding the bicycle is
such a great activity,

651
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,660
- but my bladder...
- Did you ride the bicycle alone?

652
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:26,989
Yes. You must ride the bicycle alone
to truly enjoy it.

653
00:49:27,689 --> 00:49:29,129
Besides, it's difficult...

654
00:49:29,129 --> 00:49:31,200
for regular people
to keep up with me.

655
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:33,700
On top of that, I have thighs...

656
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:35,029
as muscular as a horse.

657
00:49:35,029 --> 00:49:36,270
You know, like Son Heung Min.

658
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:42,540
Just answer my questions only.

659
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,609
On the day of the incident,
when did you start and finish...

660
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:50,580
riding your bicycle?

661
00:49:51,149 --> 00:49:53,520
I parked my car at 4 p.m.

662
00:49:53,689 --> 00:49:55,989
Was I gone for about three hours?
Well, I'm not sure.

663
00:49:55,989 --> 00:49:57,060
You have a gambling debt, don't you?

664
00:49:59,589 --> 00:50:00,730
Gambling?

665
00:50:02,330 --> 00:50:04,629
I just played a few rounds for fun.
That's all.

666
00:50:04,629 --> 00:50:06,830
You live in a low-rise apartment
in Onjeong-dong.

667
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,830
You fell behind on your rent,

668
00:50:07,830 --> 00:50:09,299
so you used up the security deposit
you put down.

669
00:50:10,339 --> 00:50:12,609
I was going to move
into Eun Sae's house soon.

670
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,910
Getting the deposit back was a hassle,
so I didn't pay rent.

671
00:50:15,370 --> 00:50:16,680
You were going
to move into her house?

672
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:18,810
You sound...

673
00:50:18,810 --> 00:50:20,980
as if you already knew that
she was going to die.

674
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:22,009
What?

675
00:50:27,250 --> 00:50:28,850
Eun Sae and I talked...

676
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,319
about moving in together
even before she died. Okay?

677
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,330
Didn't you say she made a ruckus...

678
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,390
to prevent you from visiting her
at her office?

679
00:50:34,390 --> 00:50:36,799
But you just told me
you were going to move in together.

680
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,330
Come on. Are you kidding me?

681
00:50:39,330 --> 00:50:41,000
Are you suspecting me?

682
00:50:41,469 --> 00:50:43,399
How could
a police officer suspect...

683
00:50:43,399 --> 00:50:45,870
the victim's own brother
when he had lost his only sister?

684
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:48,870
Is this how police officers treat
the bereaved family? Seriously?

685
00:50:48,870 --> 00:50:50,680
Cha Eun Sae was pregnant.

686
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:54,609
Did you know that?

687
00:50:55,779 --> 00:50:58,219
This meant
Cha Eun Sae was seeing someone.

688
00:50:58,219 --> 00:50:59,750
Can you think of anyone?

689
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:09,029
I have an appointment.
I must get going now.

690
00:51:09,029 --> 00:51:10,700
You know the novelist, Seol Woo Jae,
right?

691
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:12,799
He's been on TV quite a lot.

692
00:51:14,129 --> 00:51:16,239
The lady who hosts
"Nothing Exposed" or something?

693
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,569
Are you talking
about Seo Jung Won's husband?

694
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,739
Did your sister and Seol Woo Jae...

695
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,969
know each other?

696
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:29,620
Mr. Detective.

697
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:36,089
How would I know that?

698
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:39,290
Seriously.

699
00:51:53,339 --> 00:51:54,509
(Zeus)

700
00:51:55,980 --> 00:51:58,680
Only one phone is registered
under Seol Woo Jae's name.

701
00:52:01,009 --> 00:52:02,649
- Thank you.
- But...

702
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:06,549
(Subscriber: Draw Stories)

703
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:08,589
Your husband runs
a one-person publishing corporation,

704
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:10,359
and a phone is registered...

705
00:52:10,359 --> 00:52:11,489
under his corporation.

706
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:15,700
I didn't think that far.

707
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:17,430
What's the number?

708
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:20,899
Zero, one, zero, zero, two, three,
four, seven, eight, two, seven.

709
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,270
Can you track the location
of the phone?

710
00:52:31,509 --> 00:52:32,549
It's turned off.

711
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:39,049
Let's say he used the second phone
to communicate with only one person.

712
00:52:39,049 --> 00:52:41,489
But if he can't reach
that person anymore,

713
00:52:41,489 --> 00:52:43,120
he wouldn't carry that. Right?

714
00:52:43,819 --> 00:52:44,859
Probably.

715
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:48,589
I'll wire your service fee.

716
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,839
Hold on.
Can I take a closer look at that?

717
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,600
(Ms. Seo Jung Won,
Unit 205, Mujin Prestige)

718

719
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:20,020

(No call history)

721
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,410
It will take at least 2 to 3 days.

722
00:54:43,410 --> 00:54:44,980
Call me as soon as
you restore the data.

723
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,080
You got it.

724
00:55:00,730 --> 00:55:02,730
Eun Sae said...

725
00:55:02,230 --> 00:55:05,500
she would pay my last month's salary
with this month's salary.

726
00:55:06,770 --> 00:55:08,799
So what?

727
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:11,839
Do I look like I'm Cha Eun Sae?
Seriously. This is ridiculous.

728
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:12,969
Gosh.

729
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:14,839
My fist is itching...

730
00:55:18,140 --> 00:55:19,879
to land a punch. You know?

731
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:25,180
Your sister's manager
is asking for her salary.

732
00:55:25,549 --> 00:55:26,950
You shouldn't dismiss her request.

733
00:55:27,089 --> 00:55:29,589
I have already answered
all of your questions. Seriously.

734
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:30,819
What's this now?

735
00:55:31,890 --> 00:55:32,960
I'm not here for you.

736
00:55:33,089 --> 00:55:34,930
I'm here to talk to her today.

737
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:38,200
We talked on the phone earlier.
Do you have some time to talk?

738
00:55:39,399 --> 00:55:40,430
Let's go.

739
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:45,200
Gosh.

740
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:47,569
I'll keep my questions brief.

741
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:49,310
You can just answer them.
No need to be nervous.

742
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:51,580
Gosh.

743
00:55:53,210 --> 00:55:55,210
Here you go.

744
00:55:57,149 --> 00:55:58,219
What about me?

745
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:02,919
Please go ahead.

746
00:56:04,290 --> 00:56:06,529
Did you know anything
about Cha Eun Sae's personal life?

747
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:07,629
Like...

748
00:56:08,189 --> 00:56:09,830
a man she was seeing romantically.

749
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,060
I did think she was seeing someone.

750
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:15,500
Whenever she got a call
or a text message,

751
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:17,299
she deleted everything right away.

752
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:20,609
Eun Sae's brother
used to go through her phone.

753
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:22,640
Really?

754
00:56:22,770 --> 00:56:25,640
Who were the men she was close to?
Give us some names.

755
00:56:32,219 --> 00:56:33,419
I'm not sure.

756
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:37,160
She rarely talked about herself.
She had a lot of secrets.

757
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:40,859
Then before you became her manager,

758
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,390
Cha Geum Sae worked
as her manager, right?

759
00:56:42,589 --> 00:56:43,629
Yes.

760
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:48,000
But he was always busy gambling,
so she did most things by herself.

761
00:56:48,299 --> 00:56:50,239
Earlier, you said
he often went through her phone.

762
00:56:50,239 --> 00:56:51,739
I guess he liked to meddle
in everything she did.

763
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,339
Don't even get me started.

764
00:56:56,810 --> 00:56:58,939
He extorted money from her
and harassed her very often.

765
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:00,980
It only got worse when he was drunk.

766
00:57:02,009 --> 00:57:04,779
Two weeks ago,
we almost had to call the police.

767
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:07,120
Hey.

768
00:57:07,850 --> 00:57:09,589
Hey! You.

769
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:12,989
Do I look like a beggar to you?

770
00:57:13,660 --> 00:57:16,359
You know what happens
when I lose it.

771
00:57:18,129 --> 00:57:19,160
You little...

772
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:23,370
I'll kill you and kill myself too,
you little witch.

773
00:57:23,370 --> 00:57:25,370
A knife?

774
00:57:25,799 --> 00:57:27,040
Then it was him, for sure.

775
00:57:29,410 --> 00:57:32,540
When I think about Eun Sae,
I feel so bad for her.

776
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:35,049
Her brother was
the only family she had,

777
00:57:35,109 --> 00:57:36,919
but he harassed her
until the day she died.

778
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:47,629
The investigation is going well
for both cases,

779
00:57:47,790 --> 00:57:49,830
so don't worry about us.
Worry about your team first.

780
00:57:50,060 --> 00:57:52,399
- All right.
- You're bluffing again.

781
00:57:52,399 --> 00:57:54,000
Nothing's going well.

782
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,129
Why, that little...

783
00:57:55,129 --> 00:57:57,600
What? No, it's nothing.
Okay, talk soon.

784
00:57:59,370 --> 00:58:00,739
You little...

785
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:03,879
Gosh, you nutcase.

786
00:58:04,279 --> 00:58:06,009
The fingerprints we lifted
from the scene...

787
00:58:06,009 --> 00:58:07,750
all belong to Cha Eun Sae
and her brother.

788
00:58:07,779 --> 00:58:08,810
What?

789
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:11,680
None of the witnesses' fingerprints
were found on the doorknobs?

790
00:58:11,919 --> 00:58:14,790
The workers were all wearing gloves.

791
00:58:15,089 --> 00:58:17,120
I can't believe
they only have security cameras...

792
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:19,120
at the main entrance
and in the parking lot.

793
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:22,089
That's why it's a perfect spot
for a premeditated murder.

794
00:58:22,529 --> 00:58:24,259
You found nothing
among the victim's belongings?

795
00:58:24,830 --> 00:58:26,160
You said she was holding a necklace.

796
00:58:26,399 --> 00:58:27,899
We couldn't find her phone.

797
00:58:28,270 --> 00:58:29,730
Detective Oh
is getting her call log.

798
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:30,969
My goodness.

799
00:58:32,399 --> 00:58:34,140
You interviewed Cha Geum Sae.
What do you think?

800
00:58:34,439 --> 00:58:35,469
Do you think it was him?

801
00:58:35,710 --> 00:58:38,310
There's something fishy about him.
He threatened her recently.

802
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,080
He visited the building that day...

803
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:42,750
and couldn't prove his alibi
right away.

804
00:58:44,350 --> 00:58:45,680
You should keep on digging.

Yes, I should.

00:58:48,850 --> 00:58:52,219
Hey, is it okay with you
that you have to see Seo Jung Won?

807
00:58:54,029 --> 00:58:56,029
I can't avoid seeing her.
She's on TV all the time.

808
00:58:56,089 --> 00:58:59,259
Goodness. You know
that's not what I'm asking.

809
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,069
Whether I see her or not,
I'll always...

810
00:59:02,529 --> 00:59:04,040
think of Detective Cha
for as long as I'm a cop.

Hey, Tae Heon!

813
00:59:12,439 --> 00:59:13,580
- What is it?
- Come here.

814
00:59:17,149 --> 00:59:18,879
What's up?
Why are you being all secretive?

815
00:59:19,149 --> 00:59:21,689
Hey, do not get too excited.

816
00:59:21,790 --> 00:59:22,919
Why? You'll get me excited?

817
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,060
I went through
Cha Eun Sae's call log.

818
00:59:26,189 --> 00:59:28,160
The number
she called the most was...

819
00:59:29,629 --> 00:59:31,000
- Seol Woo Jae?
- Yes.

820
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:32,460
It's a one-man publishing company...

821
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:34,169
owned by Ms. Seo's husband.

822
00:59:35,330 --> 00:59:36,600
They talked on the phone
almost every day.

00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:40,839
I think Cha Eun Sae
was seeing Seol Woo Jae.

826
00:59:41,810 --> 00:59:43,069
What a jerk.

827
00:59:43,339 --> 00:59:45,339
I was wondering what was up...

828
00:59:44,339 --> 00:59:45,439
when you were asking Cha Geum Sae
about it.

829
00:59:45,439 --> 00:59:46,850
How did you figure it out?

830
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:50,049
Contact the mobile carrier
and find out if this number...

831
00:59:50,049 --> 00:59:52,419
was pinged at Leaders Palace
on October 6.

Yes, Ms. Yang.

Hey, get up.

01:00:17,210 --> 01:00:18,239

What is this?
How did you people get in?

838
01:00:23,379 --> 01:00:25,279
I am Seo Jung Won
from "Nothing Uncovered."

839
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:27,390
You just hit your wife, didn't you?

840
01:00:28,189 --> 01:00:30,589
Who are you to barge into my house?

841
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:32,419
Get out. I told you to get out!

842
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:34,560
Darn it!

843
01:00:34,989 --> 01:00:36,029
Show it to the camera.

844
01:00:36,759 --> 01:00:38,660
Did you hit her to get her
to sign this loan application?

845
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,930
You jerk. Turn off the camera.
Turn it off!

846
01:00:42,270 --> 01:00:43,330
Why did you marry her?

847
01:00:43,500 --> 01:00:46,399
You vowed to love her forever.
How could you deceive your wife...

848
01:00:46,399 --> 01:00:47,469
and betray her?

You know many wanted criminals
are in possession of deadly weapons.

Is it something
to get this worked up over?

I'm Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

01:06:05,719 --> 01:06:07,160
Mr. Seol Woo Jae, right?

897
01:06:07,689 --> 01:06:08,730
Yes, what is this about?

898
01:06:09,790 --> 01:06:12,200
- Why are you...
- This is about Cha Eun Sae's case.

899
01:06:14,330 --> 01:06:16,100
You'll have to come with me.

(Nothing Uncovered)

901
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:03,250
That day,
I wanted to kill Cha Eun Sae.

902
01:07:03,250 --> 01:07:04,580
It all feels like a nightmare.

903
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:07,089
I'm only going to ask you once.
Did you do it?

904
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:08,120
No!

905
01:07:08,350 --> 01:07:09,850
I'm sure the police...

906
01:07:09,850 --> 01:07:12,719
will focus on Cha Eun Sae's lover,
convinced that he killed her.

907
01:07:12,719 --> 01:07:14,089
Cha Eun Sae was your lover,
wasn't she?

908
01:07:14,589 --> 01:07:16,589
I'm a victim too.

909
01:07:15,589 --> 01:07:18,359
You know information about sponsors
comes from secret sources.

910
01:07:18,359 --> 01:07:20,029
Cha Eun Sae had a sponsor,
didn't she?

911
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:23,100
- Mo Hyung Taek?
- If you have a clear conscience.

912
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:25,069
She knew she'd die.

913
01:07:25,069 --> 01:07:27,410
The two of you
look so lovely together.

914
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:29,040
Am I the only one
who thinks this is suspicious?

915
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:31,339
It'd be more natural to think
that someone...

916
01:07:31,339 --> 01:07:33,009
is after one of us. Don't you agree?

917
01:07:33,009 --> 01:07:34,210
To me,

918
01:07:34,210 --> 01:07:35,950
you're the prime suspect now.
