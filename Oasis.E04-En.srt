I introduce to you, the CEO of Paris Salon, Kang Yeo Jin.

10
00:01:34,746 --> 00:01:36,316
Thanks.

11
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:39,996
You've worked so hard today.

12
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:41,656
What do you mean, hard work?

13
00:01:41,656 --> 00:01:43,336
More importantly,

14
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:46,636
this is quite amazing. You did the interior design yourself.

15
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,866
It's like you returned to female college days

16
00:01:49,866 --> 00:01:52,536
when you were bold, smart, and pretty.

17
00:01:52,536 --> 00:01:54,766
Why do you keep flattering me like that!

18
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,386
I'm old now.

19
00:01:56,386 --> 00:01:57,796
I mean it.

20
00:01:57,796 --> 00:02:01,036
You were more beautiful than any of the guests who came today.

21
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:04,266
You shouldn't say that even if you don't mean it.

22
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:09,176
But...

23
00:02:09,176 --> 00:02:12,026

24
00:02:12,026 --> 00:02:14,356

I didn't know that.

31
00:03:42,236 --> 00:03:48,356
I just asked the band for some recommendations for chansons with a nice vibe.

32
00:03:49,586 --> 00:03:52,086
What a coincidence.

33
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:54,116
It is probably fate.

34
00:03:54,116 --> 00:03:55,936
Or destiny.

35
00:03:58,566 --> 00:04:01,776
I don't even know the meaning of the lyrics yet.

If you keep doing this,

40
00:04:24,576 --> 00:04:27,036
I would be so sorry.

41

I must have drank too much. I'm getting a bit dizzy...

42
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,346
Are you very dizzy?

43
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:43,516
No, I think I'll be fine once I rest a bit.

It's quite late now.

My son told me he was coming home today, too.

He will probably be waiting for me.

It is all thanks to you, Team Captain.

No problem.

56
00:05:22,406 --> 00:05:24,616
It is a song that the Deputy Director listens to often,

57
00:05:24,616 --> 00:05:28,216
so wouldn't it be even better if he listens to it with you, Ms. Kang?

58
00:05:28,216 --> 00:05:30,856
I'm grateful to you for asking.

59
00:05:30,856 --> 00:05:32,776
Did you listen to it together?

60

Yes.

Of course not.

Have a drink with your mother, okay?

81
00:07:09,636 --> 00:07:12,596
I also want to have a drink with you,

but I have to go now since I have exams starting tomorrow.

83

you can't disappoint me, either.

91
00:07:41,496 --> 00:07:43,986

00:21:20,747 --> 00:21:23,797
but this is just suicide!

326
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:26,007
Hey, Seon Woo. What do you think?

327
00:21:26,007 --> 00:21:28,157
I mean, I don't care.

328
00:21:28,157 --> 00:21:29,627
I have you, Hyungnim.

329
00:21:29,627 --> 00:21:32,107
Hey, do you know how many guys they have?

330
00:21:32,107 --> 00:21:33,667
And they're not just using their fists.

331
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,427
They're all carrying weapons!

332
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:37,337
Whether you ambush them or face them head-on,

333
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:40,697
that... w-who, who was that again?

334
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,037
Yeah, even Bruce Lee would have a hard time coming back alive from that!

335
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:46,157
It doesn't matter to me.

336
00:21:46,157 --> 00:21:49,537
I would just need to beat up that one guy, Kwang Tak!

337
00:21:52,807 --> 00:21:55,427
Hey! Is this the time to be cleaning right now?

338
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:03,827
Doo Hak, are you writing the Romance of Three Kingdoms right now?

339
00:22:03,827 --> 00:22:06,357
Will the war be over once you defeat the leader of the other army?

340
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:08,797
Is the world of gangsters really that clean and neat?

341
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:09,827
Is it?

342
00:22:09,827 --> 00:22:11,637
Then what do you want me to do?

343
00:22:11,637 --> 00:22:15,157
I can't just leave Poong Ho hyung by himself.

344
00:22:15,157 --> 00:22:17,077
Surrender.

345
00:22:17,077 --> 00:22:18,247
What did you say?

346
00:22:18,247 --> 00:22:20,457
I heard that Yeom Kwang Tak is a pretty loyal guy.

347
00:22:20,457 --> 00:22:22,907
If you really go by yourself to save Poong Ho,

348
00:22:22,907 --> 00:22:25,267
then he may accept your surrender.

349
00:22:26,387 --> 00:22:28,167
After surrendering, then what?

350
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:29,927
Are you telling him to become one of Kwang Tak's minions

351
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:33,027
just to save one of our cellmates?

352
00:22:33,027 --> 00:22:36,657
For a guy who should be a high ranking gangster if he were to become one?

353
00:22:36,657 --> 00:22:38,967
Then he shouldn't become a minion.

354
00:22:41,077 --> 00:22:42,927
If I'm not a minion, then what?

355
00:22:54,737 --> 00:22:57,657
Young Pil hyung, that fighter guy... he's here...

356
00:22:57,657 --> 00:22:59,377
What are you saying, you bastard?

357
00:23:04,107 --> 00:23:07,147
Wow, look who it is. It's been a while.

358
00:23:07,147 --> 00:23:08,907
Yoo Young Pil?

359
00:23:08,907 --> 00:23:11,217
Do you remember what I told you in prison?

360
00:23:11,217 --> 00:23:13,257
That you will die before your time.

361
00:23:20,557 --> 00:23:22,167
You bastard. You dare laugh?

362
00:23:22,167 --> 00:23:24,637
Your hyungnim invited me.

363
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:27,127
So let's just go quietly.

364
00:23:43,097 --> 00:23:45,127
He's here.

365
00:23:46,977 --> 00:23:48,427
Doo Hak!

366
00:23:49,377 --> 00:23:51,227
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

367
00:23:51,227 --> 00:23:54,487
Gosh, you're quite successful, aren't you?

368
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:58,237
Seeing how you've become the boss of forgers at age 25.

369
00:23:58,237 --> 00:23:59,917
B-B...

370
00:24:01,447 --> 00:24:05,837
Y-You know, you are our b-boss.

371
00:24:05,837 --> 00:24:09,847
What's this? Are you the boss or not?

372
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:12,137
I-I...

373
00:24:12,137 --> 00:24:14,567
guess I am the boss. Yes...

374
00:24:16,767 --> 00:24:18,267
In any case,

375
00:24:18,267 --> 00:24:22,187
While growing up with Poong Ho hyung in the orphanage, we were like brothers

376
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:24,657
and shared even a bean together.

377
00:24:24,657 --> 00:24:29,287
Now that he's getting a bit successful with his business, he's completely ignoring me.

378
00:24:29,287 --> 00:24:32,277
What do you think? Since you're the boss, say something.

379
00:24:32,277 --> 00:24:34,447
It's human nature to be okay to

380
00:24:34,447 --> 00:24:39,177
split a bean to share, but not want to split a crate full of beans.

381
00:24:41,177 --> 00:24:43,277
Oh, really?

382
00:24:43,277 --> 00:24:46,807
Gosh, you're so stingy.

383
00:24:46,807 --> 00:24:50,967
Then, you will need to take responsibility as the boss, right?

384
00:24:54,437 --> 00:24:58,877
But I don't want to live being so stingy.

385
00:24:58,877 --> 00:25:00,837
I will split that crate of beans

386
00:25:00,837 --> 00:25:02,667
to share with you.

387
00:25:04,227 --> 00:25:07,387
We will become part of your family.

388
00:25:07,387 --> 00:25:10,447
What did you say? A family?

389
00:25:14,097 --> 00:25:15,847
Hyungnim.

390
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:18,687
Hey, Seon Woo.

391
00:25:38,227 --> 00:25:40,657
Is this bastard on drugs or something?

392
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:44,777
So?

393
00:25:45,917 --> 00:25:48,557
Will you accept us as your family?

394
00:25:48,557 --> 00:25:53,117
It's half of the money that our family of four earned from scalping baseball tickets.

395
00:25:53,117 --> 00:25:55,657
The law enforcement has been cracking down hard,

396
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:58,327
so we're not getting much business.

397
00:25:58,327 --> 00:26:00,497
Doo Hak...

398
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:02,287
Wow!

399
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:07,027
You've got guts! He's got what it takes.

400
00:26:07,097 --> 00:26:09,907
Have a drink with me.

401
00:26:21,487 --> 00:26:23,117
Hey.

402
00:26:23,117 --> 00:26:27,547
I heard you're not one to bow your head to anyone.

403
00:26:27,547 --> 00:26:30,627
I heard you refused to bow to Young Pil to the very end in prison.

404
00:26:30,627 --> 00:26:34,017
How come you are trying to bow your head and come under me?

405
00:26:34,017 --> 00:26:35,807
Do you want me to guess what it is?

406
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:38,847
There's a saying that is popular among kids these days.

407
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:41,567
"Keep your friends close,

408
00:26:41,567 --> 00:26:45,127
but your enemies closer."

409
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:50,577
It's easiest for those who are close to stab someone in the back.

410
00:26:50,577 --> 00:26:53,437
That is what you call a coup d'etat, you bastard.

411
00:26:53,437 --> 00:26:56,317
You know what that is, right? A coup d'etat?

412
00:26:59,707 --> 00:27:03,827
Are you trying to bring down my gang?

413
00:27:03,827 --> 00:27:05,427
Tell me.

414
00:27:06,477 --> 00:27:08,097
I'm right, no?

415
00:27:11,147 --> 00:27:15,417
Damn it, you've found out my secret.

416
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,617
You're quite sharp.

417
00:27:20,657 --> 00:27:22,207
Young Pil.

418
00:27:23,527 --> 00:27:25,477
This son of a bitch!

419
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:35,537
What are you bastards doing! Hurry up and attack him!

420
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:42,647
What if...

421
00:27:42,647 --> 00:27:44,797
he doesn't accept my surrender?

422
00:27:45,887 --> 00:27:49,637
These are tear gas grenades we picked up last time during a student protest near the baseball stadium.

423
00:27:49,637 --> 00:27:52,057
With this, you should be able to escape.

424
00:28:15,357 --> 00:28:17,057
Seon Woo!

425
00:28:55,937 --> 00:28:58,587
All right. Do you have a towel?

426
00:28:58,587 --> 00:29:00,277
Gosh.

427
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,497
Put that away, you bastard.

428
00:29:14,497 --> 00:29:17,997
You think if you just kill me, everything will be over, right?

429
00:29:17,997 --> 00:29:21,707
My underlings will follow you to the ends of the earth and chew you up.

430
00:29:21,707 --> 00:29:23,577
I won't kill you, Hyungnim.

431
00:29:23,577 --> 00:29:25,747
You won't be able to survive unless you kill me.

432
00:29:25,747 --> 00:29:30,377
So, it would be better for you to just kill me now.

433
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:33,027
I'll say it again,

434
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:36,937
but I won't die and I won't kill you, either, Hyungnim.

435
00:29:36,937 --> 00:29:38,937
Then what are you trying to do?

436
00:29:38,937 --> 00:29:40,627
The water's been already spilt.

437
00:29:40,627 --> 00:29:42,577
Even if the water's been spilt,

438
00:29:42,577 --> 00:29:46,377
you can just fill it again as long as the cup isn't broken.

439
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:02,157
Hey, Hyungnim.

440
00:30:04,197 --> 00:30:05,877
Hurry up and sit down.

441
00:30:06,987 --> 00:30:09,697
Gosh, geez.

442
00:30:13,347 --> 00:30:15,057
Hyungnim, you're not broken yet.

443
00:30:15,057 --> 00:30:17,897
We'll become your water.

444
00:30:17,897 --> 00:30:20,367
Cut the crap, you asshole.

445
00:30:20,367 --> 00:30:22,247
We mean it.

446
00:30:22,247 --> 00:30:24,587
If you would accept us,

447
00:30:24,587 --> 00:30:27,467
we will give you half of our earnings from forgery.

448
00:30:29,037 --> 00:30:31,417
What kind of game are you playing with me right now?

449
00:30:31,417 --> 00:30:33,617
I know you have great ambitions.

450
00:30:33,617 --> 00:30:36,387
You're not one to be satisfied with just Mugyo-dong.

451
00:30:36,387 --> 00:30:39,107
If you want to take over Myeong-dong and Seoul,

452
00:30:39,107 --> 00:30:41,397
you would need a fighter like me,

453
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:46,317
and I would need a lord and an organization like you and your gang, Hyungnim.

454
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:52,077
So what you're saying is that I am Liu Bei

455
00:30:52,077 --> 00:30:55,537
and that you're something like Zhao Yun?

456
00:30:56,757 --> 00:30:58,497
Think of it however you'd like.

457
00:30:58,497 --> 00:31:01,357
All right. But...

458
00:31:01,357 --> 00:31:04,357
how do I trust that you won't stab me in the back?

459
00:31:04,357 --> 00:31:06,607
Don't you think I'd need

460
00:31:06,607 --> 00:31:08,487
something as a collateral?

461
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:10,907
If you hold something as a collateral, that's a business transaction,

462
00:31:10,907 --> 00:31:13,257
and we can't become a family.

463
00:31:13,327 --> 00:31:17,227
You will be suspicious of me, no matter what I give you.

464
00:31:24,147 --> 00:31:25,977
All right.

465
00:31:29,227 --> 00:31:32,887
We will look for someone else.

466
00:31:32,887 --> 00:31:35,237
Go back home safely.

467
00:31:37,657 --> 00:31:40,057
Oath of Brotherhood...

468
00:31:40,057 --> 00:31:41,847
let's do it.

469
00:31:50,177 --> 00:31:53,047
Let's be a family, you bastard.

470
00:31:57,567 --> 00:31:59,547
Give me a cigarette.

471
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:23,007
All right, so have you done some studying?

472
00:32:23,007 --> 00:32:27,407
Boss, you want to earn more money, right?

473
00:32:27,407 --> 00:32:32,247
But there's a bit of a limit to your profits as an entertainment promoter in Gwangju and Jeonnam,

474
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:36,427
- which is only 10% of the market.
 - Your introduction is way too long.

475
00:32:36,427 --> 00:32:38,367
We should...

476
00:32:38,367 --> 00:32:41,467
enter the Gyeonggi-do market.

477
00:32:41,467 --> 00:32:42,777
What?

478
00:32:42,777 --> 00:32:44,487
Just two or three years ago,

479
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:48,017
Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do together only made up 15% of the market,

480
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:50,487
but with the growth of satellite cities around the capital,

481
00:32:50,487 --> 00:32:52,657
the market has grown much larger.

482
00:32:52,657 --> 00:32:54,987
It means there is potential.

483
00:32:54,987 --> 00:32:57,537
What in the world are you talking about?

484
00:32:57,537 --> 00:32:59,617
Do you know what kind of a business this is?

485
00:32:59,617 --> 00:33:02,107
If you try to take over someone else's territory, you'll end up in big trouble!

486
00:33:02,107 --> 00:33:03,917
You might get stabbed!

487
00:33:03,927 --> 00:33:08,227
Gyeonggi-do and Gangwon-do are already being split among three distributors.

488
00:33:08,247 --> 00:33:09,967
So how would we force our way into the market?

489
00:33:09,967 --> 00:33:12,717
We would break that triangular formation and bring one of them down,

490
00:33:12,717 --> 00:33:15,497
and then take its place.

491
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:20,357
- How?
 - We'll have to figure out a way.

492
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:23,737
But if I manage to pull this off,

493
00:33:23,737 --> 00:33:26,787
can you give me company shares?

494
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:30,797
Gosh, this girl's like a sly fox!

495
00:33:30,797 --> 00:33:32,137
All right, go for it then.

496
00:33:32,137 --> 00:33:34,647
If you manage to succeed, I won't only give you shares

497
00:33:34,647 --> 00:33:37,197
but I will even marry you.

498
00:33:37,197 --> 00:33:38,587
You mean that, right?

499
00:33:38,587 --> 00:33:42,227
You have to keep this promise, okay?

500
00:33:43,207 --> 00:33:46,997
This girl already has something in mind, huh?

501
00:33:46,997 --> 00:33:49,457
All right. Go ahead and try.

502
00:33:49,457 --> 00:33:52,847
Wait— P-President Cha!

503
00:33:55,707 --> 00:33:57,677
How much shares does Kwang Tak hyungnim own again?

504
00:33:57,677 --> 00:34:00,397
30% on management, with no invested capital.

505
00:34:00,397 --> 00:34:01,777
30%?

506
00:34:01,777 --> 00:34:03,497
He's such a thief.

507
00:34:03,497 --> 00:34:05,597
If you live on spending your own money,

508
00:34:05,597 --> 00:34:08,667
then you're not a real gangster!

509
00:34:08,667 --> 00:34:10,977
But those punks did some shitty bookkeeping.

510
00:34:10,977 --> 00:34:13,127
Not to mention the sales, even.

511
00:34:13,127 --> 00:34:15,467
Young Pil seems to be pocketing some money by creating

512
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:19,027
a false ledger with the liquor wholesaler he looks after.

513
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:20,517
I see.

514
00:34:26,227 --> 00:34:29,437
I really can't understand what the boss was  thinking

515
00:34:29,437 --> 00:34:31,047
when he decided to take him in.

516
00:34:31,047 --> 00:34:34,317
Hey, let's say we can take him in to boost our fighting power.

517
00:34:34,317 --> 00:34:38,487
But how can he be in the same ranks as our hyungnim?

518
00:34:38,487 --> 00:34:39,797
Don't you agree, Hyungnim?

519
00:34:39,797 --> 00:34:41,087
These punks, seriously.

520
00:34:41,087 --> 00:34:42,757
You're ruining appetite.

521
00:34:43,807 --> 00:34:46,077
- I'm sorry!
- I'm sorry, Hyungnim.

522
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,457
Is this a soup and rice shop?

523
00:34:54,797 --> 00:35:00,567
Aigoo, of course, there wouldn't be any customers at this luxurious hotel

524
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,287
since it reeks of soup and radish kimchi.

525
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:12,857
I know he entrusted this place to you.

526
00:35:12,857 --> 00:35:17,187
But I need to have lunch and coffee here to have good digestion.

527
00:35:17,187 --> 00:35:19,377
I'll buy you digestive medicine if you've got digestion problems.

528
00:35:19,377 --> 00:35:22,907
So order from the existing menu from now on.

529
00:35:22,907 --> 00:35:24,717
Make sure to pay, though.

530
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,467
This little punk...

531
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:29,507
Have some coffee before you go.

532
00:35:29,507 --> 00:35:31,847
It's my treat today.

533
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:33,807
We're family, right?

534
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,387
Family, my foot.

535
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:41,127
I don't consider you to be my family.

536
00:35:41,127 --> 00:35:42,937
Watch out.

537
00:35:51,907 --> 00:35:54,537
Let's get along, okay?

538
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,667
I'll do my best!

539
00:35:59,687 --> 00:36:03,217
- Let's go.
- How ridiculous.

540
00:36:03,217 --> 00:36:05,787
Yes, President Yoon.

541
00:36:05,787 --> 00:36:08,887
Me? I'm working.

542
00:36:08,887 --> 00:36:10,567
For what business?

543
00:36:10,567 --> 00:36:12,417
What did you say?

544
00:36:12,417 --> 00:36:18,247
Gosh, why do you keep asking for my guys for such embarrassing things?

545
00:36:18,247 --> 00:36:21,237
What did you  say? Okay.

546
00:36:21,237 --> 00:36:24,347
Aigoo. Make sure you treat my guys, then.

547
00:36:24,347 --> 00:36:27,567
Yes, yes. Oh, and also...

548
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:31,087
you know, after the shooting, the actress...

549
00:36:31,087 --> 00:36:32,647
That's right.

550
00:36:33,867 --> 00:36:40,347
Yes, yes. No, just naturally invite her to drink. All right?

551
00:36:40,347 --> 00:36:41,957
Rotary club and all full amenity.

552
00:36:43,087 --> 00:36:44,837
This is a gift from Hyungnim.

553
00:36:44,837 --> 00:36:47,647
Let me know if there's anything you need.

554
00:36:51,047 --> 00:36:53,077
<i>Thank you, Hyungnim!</i>

555
00:36:53,077 --> 00:36:54,987
I'll make this short.

556
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:59,307
From now on, there's no such thing as one taking or eating more than the other.

557
00:36:59,307 --> 00:37:04,687
A family eats, poops, and fights together. Understood?

558
00:37:04,687 --> 00:37:05,977
<i>Yes, Hyungnim!</i>

559
00:37:05,977 --> 00:37:07,567
Raise your glasses.

560
00:37:08,747 --> 00:37:11,637
- Cheers.
- <i>Cheers!</i>

561
00:37:14,947 --> 00:37:16,327
My, my.

562
00:37:17,387 --> 00:37:19,377
Okay, okay.

563
00:37:19,377 --> 00:37:21,927
Aigoo, shit.

564
00:37:27,637 --> 00:37:29,127
Yes.

565
00:37:29,127 --> 00:37:31,077
Hey, where's Doo Hak?

566
00:37:34,157 --> 00:37:35,437
Aigoo!

567
00:37:36,327 --> 00:37:37,907
Gosh!

568
00:37:40,807 --> 00:37:42,167
<i>Got it.</i>

569
00:37:43,287 --> 00:37:46,537
Manager, I heard the shooting was delayed a lot.

570
00:37:46,537 --> 00:37:48,357
Will we be able to finish by the premiere date?

571
00:37:48,357 --> 00:37:50,217
I won't let those bastards go.

572
00:37:51,167 --> 00:37:55,327
I'll take care of it myself, so Namdo Film Studio stay out of this. Okay?

573
00:37:55,327 --> 00:37:57,137
Gosh, Manager!

574
00:37:57,137 --> 00:38:00,117
Where are you going?

575
00:38:00,117 --> 00:38:01,687
Gosh.

576
00:38:03,917 --> 00:38:08,687
- Open the criminals mouth and feed her the poison!
- <i>Yes, sir!</i>

577
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:12,897
<i>Your Highness!</i>

578
00:38:12,897 --> 00:38:14,397
<i>No, Your Highness!</i>

579
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:16,027
<i>Your Highness!</i>

580
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:19,147
Is the poison she ate a real poison?

581
00:38:19,147 --> 00:38:20,497
It's an herbal tea.

582
00:38:20,497 --> 00:38:21,897
Oh, an herbal tea.

583
00:38:21,897 --> 00:38:23,627
Gosh, I'm so glad.

584
00:38:23,627 --> 00:38:26,717
<i>- No!
- Your Highness!</i>

585
00:38:26,717 --> 00:38:28,177
<i>Your Highness!</i>

586
00:38:28,177 --> 00:38:29,617
<i>- Your Highness!</i>
- By the way...

587
00:38:29,617 --> 00:38:32,617
That court lady seems to be wearing a watch.

588
00:38:33,747 --> 00:38:35,577
Awesome.

589
00:38:35,577 --> 00:38:36,967
Cut!

590
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:39,757
Gosh... hey!

591
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:43,357
- What's going on now?
- What's that? Oh, my. Wait.

592
00:38:43,357 --> 00:38:45,897
Whoa! What the heck?

593
00:38:45,897 --> 00:38:47,037
Director!

594
00:38:47,037 --> 00:38:49,357
Wait, help me get back up.

595
00:38:49,357 --> 00:38:52,417
Gosh. What the heck is this? Is it no good?

596
00:38:52,417 --> 00:38:54,667
Bravo!

597
00:38:55,537 --> 00:39:00,017
Song Yeon Ju, a male director wanted by the 21st century so badly

598
00:39:00,017 --> 00:39:02,547
is waiting for you right now.

599
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,597
Please hurry up and come out.

600
00:39:05,547 --> 00:39:09,077
He seems to be from the other movie Song Yeon Ju is a part of.

601
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,557
Hey! Tell him to keep waiting!

602
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,987
We also need to finish this scene today, okay?

603
00:39:14,987 --> 00:39:16,967
Hey, everyone, gather!

604
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,277
If you don't move out in three seconds,

605
00:39:20,647 --> 00:39:23,357
- we won't hold back anymore.
- N-No one told you to hold back!

606
00:39:23,357 --> 00:39:25,157
One!

607
00:39:25,157 --> 00:39:27,277
Two!

608
00:39:27,277 --> 00:39:29,337
- Go.
- Wh-Whoa—

609
00:39:29,337 --> 00:39:31,547
- Move!
- W-Wait—

610
00:39:31,547 --> 00:39:32,757
What's this?

611
00:39:32,757 --> 00:39:34,727
- Aigoo.
- Gosh, no!

612
00:39:34,727 --> 00:39:37,037
- Aigoo.
- Let go!

613
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,967
- Huh?
- Oh, my gosh!

614
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,177
You want to die?

615
00:39:45,177 --> 00:39:46,967
- Sit down.
- You almost had me there!

616
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,507
- Sit down!
- Come on.

617
00:39:49,827 --> 00:39:52,027
Aigoo! You can't!

618
00:39:52,027 --> 00:39:54,217
Let go. Let go of me!

619
00:39:54,217 --> 00:39:56,777
You assholes!

620
00:39:56,777 --> 00:39:58,397
Seriously.

621
00:39:59,817 --> 00:40:01,717
Gosh, this little!

622
00:40:01,717 --> 00:40:02,887
Hey.

623
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:05,317
Escort her politely.

624
00:40:05,317 --> 00:40:07,407
- Mind your manners.
- I'm sorry.

625
00:40:07,407 --> 00:40:10,097
Not to me. Okay?

626
00:40:10,097 --> 00:40:11,617
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:17,937 --> 00:40:20,557
Hey, forget it. Let's go.

628
00:40:20,557 --> 00:40:21,937
Yes, Hyungnim.

629
00:40:21,937 --> 00:40:24,347
- We're done here.
- Please come this way.

630
00:40:24,347 --> 00:40:26,827
Who dares to intrude a sacred filming set—

631
00:40:26,827 --> 00:40:29,557
You can't take her like that! We need to finish this scene!

632
00:40:29,557 --> 00:40:31,717
- You can't!
- You can't do this!

633
00:40:31,717 --> 00:40:33,267
J-Jung—

634
00:40:33,267 --> 00:40:35,237
No, you can't—

635
00:40:57,757 --> 00:40:59,157
Lee Doo Hak?

636
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:01,857
Long time no see.

637
00:41:01,857 --> 00:41:03,867
Why are you here?

638
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,807
Jung Shin, what are you doing? Hurry up and move aside.

639
00:41:07,807 --> 00:41:09,277
Leave.

640
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:12,577
I'm sorry to interrupt, Hyungnim.

641
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,127
We need to bring Song Yeon Ju quickly.

642
00:41:14,127 --> 00:41:17,527
They insisted the daytime scene must be filmed today.

643
00:41:18,507 --> 00:41:19,937
Are you a thug?

644
00:41:21,057 --> 00:41:22,357
A thug?

645
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:26,897
- Excuse me, lady. You talk a little too nicely.
- Seon Woo.

646
00:41:26,897 --> 00:41:28,587
You can stay out of this.

647
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:34,307
I said, are you a thug?

648
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:36,627
Yes.

649
00:41:49,267 --> 00:41:52,717
You avoided my visits merely to live like this?

650
00:41:52,717 --> 00:41:54,937
I never avoided them.

651
00:41:54,937 --> 00:41:57,107
I ended up in jail because of you.

652
00:41:57,107 --> 00:41:59,547
If it were you, would you want to see you?

653
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:01,407
You really...

654
00:42:01,407 --> 00:42:04,747
- Do you really think I was to blame?
- Also...

655
00:42:04,747 --> 00:42:07,597
I'm doing my best in life in my own way.

656
00:42:07,597 --> 00:42:11,277
A thief who's diligently stealing is doing his best as well then, huh?

657
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:14,847
A petty thief who stole a wallet gets scorned,

658
00:42:14,847 --> 00:42:16,867
but a big thief who stole a country

659
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:19,407
is feared by the world.

660
00:42:19,407 --> 00:42:21,507
You really lost your mind, huh?

661
00:42:21,507 --> 00:42:23,427
That's not it.

662
00:42:23,427 --> 00:42:27,437
The one you used to know had lost his mind.

663
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:32,127
Having ridiculous thoughts such as thinking you'll be blessed if you're loyal to your parents,

664
00:42:32,127 --> 00:42:34,667
study hard, and be patriotic to your country.

665
00:42:35,877 --> 00:42:38,457
In this twisted world,

666
00:42:38,457 --> 00:42:40,797
living in a twisted way is the correct way.

667
00:42:40,797 --> 00:42:42,557
Whoa...

668
00:42:42,557 --> 00:42:44,767
Lee Doo Hak, you really...

669
00:42:45,977 --> 00:42:48,707
became a complete trash.

670
00:42:52,637 --> 00:42:54,357
Trash?

671
00:42:58,097 --> 00:42:59,817
Sure.

672
00:42:59,817 --> 00:43:02,667
The noble daughter of a theater-running family...

673
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:05,947
should never encounter this trash again.

674
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:12,067
- Hey, let's withdraw!
- Yes, Hyungnim.

675
00:43:20,957 --> 00:43:24,037
You should drink more slowly.

676
00:43:24,037 --> 00:43:26,087
You somehow knew where I was, huh?

677
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:29,517
Did you get used to Seoul yet?

678
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:40,637
Is something wrong?

679
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:44,327
You...

680
00:43:44,387 --> 00:43:46,697
keep in touch with Doo Hak, right?

681
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:51,157
Yes.

682
00:43:51,157 --> 00:43:53,437
Since he's my hyung and friend.

683
00:43:53,437 --> 00:43:55,877
He's your hyung and friend,

684
00:43:55,877 --> 00:43:58,437
but you let him live as a thug?

685
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:05,947
You met him?

686
00:44:05,947 --> 00:44:07,757
Yes.

687
00:44:07,757 --> 00:44:09,697
I met him when...

688
00:44:09,697 --> 00:44:13,047
he barged into our filming set to snatch out an actress.

689
00:44:15,467 --> 00:44:17,237
It must be great to be you!

690
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:20,047
You have a thug as a friend.

691
00:44:24,227 --> 00:44:26,107
We're not at young ages anymore.

692
00:44:26,107 --> 00:44:29,517
Who would listen to who? We just...

693
00:44:29,517 --> 00:44:32,067
live according to our fates.

694
00:44:32,067 --> 00:44:33,477
Fates.

695
00:44:34,347 --> 00:44:36,237
Fates?

696
00:44:36,237 --> 00:44:39,747
Are people who used to be servants of your place all fated to be thugs?

697
00:44:39,747 --> 00:44:42,927
Are all ex-convicts fated to live as thugs?

698
00:44:42,927 --> 00:44:46,677
Even if the entire world points its fingers at him, at least...

699
00:44:46,677 --> 00:44:50,097
you shouldn't be doing the same, you asshole!

700
00:44:52,407 --> 00:44:54,557
There's no such thing as fate in this world.

701
00:45:11,897 --> 00:45:14,167
<i>Lee Doo Hak, you really...</i>

702
00:45:15,277 --> 00:45:18,427
<i>became a complete trash.</i>

703
00:45:23,297 --> 00:45:25,617
Aigoo. Are you okay?

704
00:45:25,617 --> 00:45:28,237
I told you to drink in moderation.

705
00:45:28,237 --> 00:45:29,627
Cheol Woong...

706
00:45:30,547 --> 00:45:32,887
I have a request.

707
00:45:32,887 --> 00:45:34,807
Please bring...

708
00:45:36,297 --> 00:45:38,847
Doo Hak out of that place.

709
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:43,687
Don't let him live as a thug, please?

710
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:46,167
You're really the only one.

711
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:49,867
If you let him live like that...

712
00:45:49,867 --> 00:45:53,337
it's too unfortunate for Doo Hak.

713
00:45:53,337 --> 00:45:57,207
It's too unfortunate for our poor Doo Hak.

714
00:46:06,187 --> 00:46:07,507
Jung Shin...

715
00:46:08,567 --> 00:46:10,357
can't you...

716
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:13,697
forget about him now?

717
00:46:18,777 --> 00:46:20,807
Cheol Woong...

718
00:46:20,807 --> 00:46:23,847
I have something to ask you.

719
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:25,917
Please tell me honestly.

720
00:46:27,077 --> 00:46:28,577
Go ahead.

721
00:46:28,577 --> 00:46:30,127
Did...

722
00:46:31,367 --> 00:46:34,147
Doo Hak really kill a person?

723
00:46:35,997 --> 00:46:39,627
No matter how I think about it, he's not the type to do such thing.

724
00:46:43,917 --> 00:46:45,707
He did.

725
00:46:45,707 --> 00:46:47,467
Doo Hak hyung was the one.

726
00:46:48,477 --> 00:46:51,927
He was avenging me on the guy who beat me up.

727
00:46:51,927 --> 00:46:53,797
But there was an accident.

728
00:46:56,117 --> 00:46:58,717
What a twisted life that asshole has.

729
00:47:00,747 --> 00:47:04,307
Isn't this really too harsh?

730
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:08,237
Aren't you being too harsh on that poor kid?

731
00:47:25,077 --> 00:47:28,567
Gosh, I'm about to die, seriously.

732
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:32,177
Whoa, just how much did you drink?

733
00:47:32,177 --> 00:47:34,487
It still reeks of alcohol!

734
00:47:34,487 --> 00:47:35,987
What's that? Is it hangover soup?

735
00:47:35,987 --> 00:47:38,357
Gosh, Yang Ja, you're the best.

736
00:47:38,357 --> 00:47:39,907
Gosh, the heartburn.

737
00:47:41,037 --> 00:47:43,567
My heart burns more, you wench.

738
00:47:44,567 --> 00:47:48,957
You even have a knight who brings your drunken ass home, huh?

739
00:47:48,957 --> 00:47:50,297
Who did?

740
00:47:51,267 --> 00:47:52,797
Don't you remember?

741
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,727
Cheol Woong brought you all the way home.

742
00:47:55,727 --> 00:47:57,517
Cheol Woong did?

743
00:47:57,527 --> 00:48:01,757
Did you really black out or are you pretending?

744
00:48:01,757 --> 00:48:03,957
That can't be, though.

745
00:48:03,957 --> 00:48:05,767
I haven't seen him since high school.

746
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:08,777
But he became really handsome.

747
00:48:10,237 --> 00:48:13,837
By the way, since when have you two been talking?

748
00:48:16,567 --> 00:48:19,277
Wait, more importantly— Where did it go?

749
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:20,967
What time is it right now?

750
00:48:20,967 --> 00:48:25,487
Whoa! I'm late, late. So late!

751
00:48:25,487 --> 00:48:29,557
- Hey, I prepared the meal! Eat it before you go!
- I don't have the time!

752
00:48:31,897 --> 00:48:33,547
But seriously, what's up with your hair?

753
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:35,197
Are you a ball of iron?

754
00:48:35,197 --> 00:48:38,147
My hair just doesn't grow. What can I do?

755
00:48:38,147 --> 00:48:39,757
Who is he?

756
00:48:40,927 --> 00:48:42,937
He's my guest.

757
00:48:54,487 --> 00:48:56,757
Wait, so...

758
00:48:56,757 --> 00:49:00,627
did you come to advise me to stop being a thug?

759
00:49:00,627 --> 00:49:02,687
Nope.

760
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:05,857
What right do I have? I'm also a trash.

761
00:49:06,947 --> 00:49:08,697
It seems...

762
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:12,067
Jung Shin still isn't over you, Hyung.

763
00:49:12,937 --> 00:49:14,897
She cried a lot.

764
00:49:22,067 --> 00:49:24,157
She must've pitied me.

765
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,667
I don't think that was all.

766
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:30,797
When you were in prison, it seems she wrote letters constantly

767
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:32,997
and went to visit you frequently, too.

768
00:49:34,037 --> 00:49:36,047
Why did you break up?

769
00:49:40,127 --> 00:49:42,747
It was just too nasty.

770
00:49:42,747 --> 00:49:44,757
So I broke up with her.

771
00:49:45,717 --> 00:49:47,957
Let's stop talking about this.

772
00:49:47,957 --> 00:49:51,877
Talking about young love and memories, it's childish.

773
00:50:04,367 --> 00:50:05,917
Hyung...

774
00:50:07,937 --> 00:50:09,917
do I have to become a prosecutor?

775
00:50:11,087 --> 00:50:12,457
Yes.

776
00:50:12,457 --> 00:50:14,127
Before you graduate.

777
00:50:16,607 --> 00:50:18,877
In that case...

778
00:50:18,877 --> 00:50:21,307
since I'm granting your wish...

779
00:50:21,307 --> 00:50:23,927
you grant my wish, too.

780
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:30,537
I can...

781
00:50:31,607 --> 00:50:34,107
go out with Jung Shin now, right?

782
00:50:42,557 --> 00:50:44,277
Hey, Cheol Woong...

783
00:50:45,147 --> 00:50:50,217
there's nothing between Jung Shin and I anymore.

784
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:51,897
You mean it, right?

785
00:50:51,897 --> 00:50:54,027
You mean what you just said, right?

786
00:50:54,027 --> 00:50:55,397
However...

787
00:50:56,447 --> 00:50:58,687
you still shouldn't go out with her.

788
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:08,447
She's a stranger to you, so for what reason?

789
00:51:08,447 --> 00:51:10,507
You said in your own words earlier...

790
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:12,227
that you're also a trash.

791
00:51:13,497 --> 00:51:16,317
At least for old times' sakes,

792
00:51:16,317 --> 00:51:20,457
Jung Shin shouldn't go out with trash like us.

793
00:51:20,457 --> 00:51:22,197
Isn't that so?

794
00:51:22,197 --> 00:51:24,537
You're the one who made become a trash.

795
00:51:25,437 --> 00:51:26,367
What did you say?

796
00:51:26,367 --> 00:51:29,127
Don't think you're the only victim, Hyung.

797
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:33,817
I haven't felt at peace even for a single day, ever since that day.

798
00:51:33,817 --> 00:51:35,697
That's why...

799
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:38,167
I'm telling you to leave Jung Shin alone.

800
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:40,857
Are you going to go to Jung Shin and tell her?

801
00:51:41,847 --> 00:51:44,197
That I'm actually the murderer?

802
00:51:45,127 --> 00:51:47,727
If that's not the case, then why?

803
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:50,777
Why on Earth can't I?

804
00:51:53,207 --> 00:51:56,297
Jung Shin looking at me,

805
00:51:56,297 --> 00:52:01,207
who has become a thug, with disgust by your side...

806
00:52:01,207 --> 00:52:03,657
It annoys me just thinking about it.

807
00:52:05,477 --> 00:52:07,977
You think you always yielded for me, huh?

808
00:52:07,977 --> 00:52:09,707
Don't be mistaken.

809
00:52:09,707 --> 00:52:16,237
Hyung, you have never really considered me your friend or dongsaeng.

810
00:52:18,287 --> 00:52:21,157
Since you can no longer gain Jung Shin's heart,

811
00:52:21,157 --> 00:52:23,867
you're telling me not to date her, either?

812
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:27,127
What kind of bullshit is that!

813
00:52:27,127 --> 00:52:30,077
You and I are both shitty people.

01:02:02,790 --> 01:02:05,390
Whoa...

978
01:02:05,390 --> 01:02:08,620
No, not at all. We need to hurry back.

979
01:02:08,620 --> 01:02:10,920
We have farming work piled up.

980
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,330
Don't even mention it.

981
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:17,420
This man is farming on a strip of land in Seoul.

982
01:02:17,420 --> 01:02:18,770
Gosh.

983
01:02:18,770 --> 01:02:21,770
I can afford to stay a night.

984
01:02:21,770 --> 01:02:23,770
This woman, seriously.

985
01:02:23,770 --> 01:02:25,780
You have tons of work to do!

986
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:30,440
Aigoo, you're same as ever, Uncle.

987
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:33,050
Cheol Woong, don't mind us.

988
01:02:33,050 --> 01:02:35,530
- I'll be going ahead, okay?
- Okay.

989
01:02:36,630 --> 01:02:41,750
- In that case, I'll come and visit you soon.
- Sure.

990
01:02:42,850 --> 01:02:44,790
You did well.

991
01:02:44,790 --> 01:02:47,550
Please take care.

992
01:02:54,030 --> 01:02:56,770
Why? Are you expecting someone?

993
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,210
Huh?

994
01:02:59,620 --> 01:03:01,550
It's nothing at all.

995
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:18,960
Congrats. For him to pass the civil exam so soon...

996
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:20,610
who does he take after to be smart?

997
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,290
Is it the mom or the dad?

998
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:24,510
We'll need to say it's the mom.

999
01:03:24,510 --> 01:03:26,320
All right.

1000
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:29,080
While we're on the topic, Oppa,

1001
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,650
I have a request.

1002
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:33,550
Sure, a request from you. What is it?

1003
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,980
Cheol Woong wants to be a prosecutor.

1004
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,200
Please help him.

1005
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,970
His bar exam score was it the top rankings.

1006
01:03:41,970 --> 01:03:46,700
However, according to Minister of Justice's wife who comes to our store,

1007
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:51,180
it's impossible to be a judge or prosecutor if you have a history of being a student activist.

1008
01:03:51,180 --> 01:03:52,840
Yes.

1009
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:56,600
Cheol Woong will need to be an attorney. I can't help with that, either.

1010
01:03:56,600 --> 01:04:01,790
It's obvious there  will be more controversy if we say he was actually an informant of a government agency.

1011
01:04:01,790 --> 01:04:05,720
Isn't that actually the reason they should let him be a prosecutor?

1012
01:04:05,720 --> 01:04:08,970
He sealed his mouth shut and worked for the country.

1013
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:10,470
It's not that easy.

1014
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,260
When I looked at the records,

1015
01:04:12,260 --> 01:04:15,330
he never provided any solid info on the student union's members.

1016
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,820
He made it through by walking on the tightrope.

1017
01:04:17,820 --> 01:04:20,970
He's neither black or white, but grey.

1018
01:04:23,710 --> 01:04:25,940
He wishes to become a prosecutor.

1019
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,810
And my wish is the same.

1020
01:04:30,140 --> 01:04:34,440
If he had cooperated with the agency, we could've said he's an elite prosecutor.

1021
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,220
But the world isn't easy.

1022
01:04:36,220 --> 01:04:38,440
Although his smart like his mother,

1023
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:43,240
his stubborn way of living to protect his cheap conscience takes after his father.

1024
01:04:54,190 --> 01:04:55,890
That's true.

1025
01:04:57,670 --> 01:05:00,280
He takes after his father.

1026
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:04,360
Cheol Woong is...

1027
01:05:05,460 --> 01:05:08,990
just like his biological father,

1028
01:05:10,100 --> 01:05:12,470
so he has ambitions.

1029
01:05:12,470 --> 01:05:15,140
He desires to have power.

1030
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:23,390
Whoa.

1031
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,660
You need to at least say hi if you're here.

1032
01:05:25,660 --> 01:05:27,400
How can you just leave?

1033
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,180
Good job.

1034
01:05:29,180 --> 01:05:31,260
Go let out some stress.

1035
01:05:33,250 --> 01:05:35,090
What's this?

1036
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,390
Oh, my.

1037
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:44,430
Lee Doo Hak's become so lavish after becoming Gwang Tak gang's number two, huh?

1038
01:05:44,430 --> 01:05:45,930
How cool.

1039
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,770
Anyway...

1040
01:05:48,770 --> 01:05:52,860
I've completed your order at this point, right?

1041
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,950
Don't be arrogant.

1042
01:05:56,340 --> 01:06:00,510
You finally got the qualifications to pay me back. This is the beginning.

1043
01:06:00,510 --> 01:06:04,230
That's right. It's the beginning.

1044
01:06:04,230 --> 01:06:06,000
By the way...

1045
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:09,600
I'm trying to start something else, too.

1046
01:06:12,020 --> 01:06:13,700
I'm going to...

1047
01:06:14,950 --> 01:06:17,100
make Jung Shin my woman.

1048
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:20,920
Of course.

1049
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,690
He is also a foolish father,

1050
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,110
who still doesn't recognize his son,

1051
01:06:28,110 --> 01:06:31,110
who is right in front of his eyes.

1052
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,070
Please...

1053
01:06:35,070 --> 01:06:38,010
help Cheol Woong become a prosecutor...

1054
01:06:41,600 --> 01:06:43,630
as his father.

1055
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,700
Stop acting wicked.

1056
01:06:49,700 --> 01:06:53,200
I fully know you haven't gotten over Jung Shin yet.

1057
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:58,320
If you want, Hyung, let's compete again like we did in high school.

1058
01:06:58,320 --> 01:07:00,730
It'll be a fair play.

1059
01:07:00,730 --> 01:07:02,160
Okay?

1060
01:07:03,310 --> 01:07:05,130
