1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,570
(All locations, characters,
organizations, and incidents...)

2
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:13,210
(in this drama are fictitious.)

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:17,080
(Episode 3)

4
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:30,929
Hey, it suits you.

5
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:33,400
You told me
that I had to wear this today.

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:35,299
You look pretty.

7
00:00:36,569 --> 00:00:37,600
Let's go.

8
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:44,009
It's completely empty.

9
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,119
This is...

10
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,220
our wedding.

11
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,459
So, this is my bridal bouquet?

12
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,709
I know you said
you didn't want a wedding,

13
00:01:51,669 --> 00:01:53,979
but you're marrying
a business tycoon's son,

14
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,479
so I couldn't completely
forgo the ceremony.

15
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:13,300
This is...

16
00:02:13,929 --> 00:02:15,970
the most romantic moment of my life
so far.

17
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:22,769
Jung Won.

18
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,609
Thank you for being mine.

19
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:28,609
I'll make sure you can always stay
as fragrant and radiant as you are.

20
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,380
I love you.

21
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,079
Hey, Jung Won.

22
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,449
Our wedding ceremony ended
in four minutes.

23
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,120
Seol Woo Jae.

24
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,889
Why did you go to Leaders Palace
the day Cha Eun Sae died?

25
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,940
Who is it?

26
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,380
I'm a detective
from Gangha Police Station.

27
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,190
I'm from Gangha Police Station's
Violent Crimes Unit One.

28
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,900
I'm Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

29
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,299
Mr. Seol Woo Jae, right?

30
00:03:57,530 --> 00:03:59,530
Yes, what is this about?

31
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,799
- Why are you...
- This is about Cha Eun Sae's case.

32
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:05,710
You'll have to come with me.

33
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:14,620
Why do you need to
interview my husband as a witness?

34
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,350
You can ask him later.

35
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,829
We couldn't reach you,

36
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,299
so I came here to find you.

37
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,999
We need to ask you some questions,
so please come with me.

38
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:32,229
Sure.

39
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,970
I won't be long.

40
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:39,169
Let's go.

41
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:02,429
Detective Oh.

42
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:04,070
Mr. Seol's newest novel,

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,070
"Hot Shot." Have you read it?

44
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,109
Well, I only read books
when I can't fall asleep.

45
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,410
It's good. You have to read it.

46
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,439
A woman in the story...

47
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,249
gets stabbed several times
in the stomach and dies.

48
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:19,350
- What?
- While writing the book,

49
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,979
you must've gained
a lot of criminal knowledge.

50
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,489
But I'm still an amateur
compared to you detectives.

51
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,689
Mr. Seol.

52
00:05:28,189 --> 00:05:29,489
You must know why...

53
00:05:29,489 --> 00:05:31,160
we're interviewing you
as a witness in Cha Eun Sae's case.

54
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,100
According to her call history,

55
00:05:37,429 --> 00:05:39,169
you were the person...

56
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:40,939
she called the most.

57
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,410
And you were the last person
she called the day she died.

58
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:46,410
- Is that so?
- "Is that so?"

59
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,350
Cha Eun Sae was your lover,
wasn't she?

60
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:54,850
Cha Eun Sae was my stalker.

61
00:05:54,919 --> 00:05:56,049
You two weren't lovers?

62
00:05:56,049 --> 00:05:57,789
I'm sure you can gather this much
from the call log.

63
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,689
She kept calling me.
I never called her.

64
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:02,059
Did you go through her phone?

65
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,229
Did you find anything
to prove that we were lovers?

66
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:06,960
Unfortunately, her phone
wasn't found at the scene,

67
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,960
so we couldn't check.

68
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,970
Really? That is unfortunate.

69
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,570
So? She stalked you, and that's it?

70
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,669
I'm a victim too.

71
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,410
When did she start stalking you?

72
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:23,280
We met last year at an afterparty
at the publishing house.

73
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:26,650
After that, she started
getting obsessed with me.

74
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:30,789
She'd call and visit me whenever
she could and get all clingy.

75
00:06:31,489 --> 00:06:32,549
To give you an example.

76
00:06:32,749 --> 00:06:34,859
When was the last time
you saw her, then?

77
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,729
She used to show up at my studio
unannounced from time to time.

78
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,600
I think I saw her
about two weeks ago.

79
00:06:41,999 --> 00:06:44,129
Then approximately at 4 p.m.
on October 6,

80
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:47,100
why did you go to Leaders Palace?

81
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,119
He was there an hour before
the estimated time of her death.

82
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:09,119
Why was he there?

83
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:10,460
I went to the Chinese restaurant
on the third floor...

84
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,590
to pick up some food.

85
00:07:11,929 --> 00:07:13,799
Then you'll probably ask me
where I went after that.

86
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,359
I went to my studio.

87
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,570
I bet you knew that her agency's office
was in that building too.

88
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,499
- No, I didn't know that.
- Between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m. that day,

89
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,010
where were you? And what did you do?

90
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:28,510
I was drinking at my studio, alone.

91
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:30,510
Alone?

92
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,179
You were...

93
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,220
alone?

94
00:07:35,850 --> 00:07:36,989
Cha Eun Sae...

95
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,689
was pregnant.

96
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,820
I thought
you were the father of the baby.

97
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,729
But you're saying she stalked you.

98
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:46,929
I'm quite flustered.

99
00:07:46,929 --> 00:07:48,460
I'm more flustered.

100
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:50,700
Ask her sponsor, not me.

101
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
Oh, wait.

102
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:57,470
You didn't know?

103
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,179
Cha Eun Sae once told me
about her sponsor.

104
00:08:01,479 --> 00:08:03,879
I assumed
you'd be looking into it already.

105
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:05,809
I guess I gave you a hint.

106
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,049
Cha Eun Sae said that?

107
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:11,119
- Who was her...
- She never told me who it was.

108
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,989
Since you two are pros,
I believe it's your job to find out.

109
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,090
Hey, why do you keep cutting me off?

110
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:22,330
The way you're talking tells me
that you look down on the police.

111
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:24,669
- Detective Oh.
- Without a thorough investigation,

112
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:28,369
you concluded that I was her lover,
which was unprofessional of you.

113
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,510
At 4:30 p.m. on October 6,

114
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,770
what did Cha Eun Sae say
when she called you?

115
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,920
"You obnoxious jerk."

116
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:50,930
That's what she said.

117
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:55,859
She called me obnoxious
because I was married...

118
00:08:57,029 --> 00:08:58,129
and wouldn't like her back.

119
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,470
Are we done?

120
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,239
The interview is done,

121
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:07,979
but we're collecting DNA samples...

122
00:09:07,979 --> 00:09:09,779
from all witnesses
to find the baby's father.

123
00:09:10,609 --> 00:09:12,550
You'll give us your consent
to collect a sample from you, right?

124
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:15,749
Because you're married after all,
like you said.

125
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,290
Decline without a valid reason,
and we'll get a warrant to do it.

126
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,460
Sign this.

127
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,170
Will you say "ah" for me?

128
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,609
"Ah."

129
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,190
Confirm if Seol
ordered Chinese takeout,

130
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:57,659
from the third floor on the sixth,

131
00:09:57,659 --> 00:09:59,460
and trace his movements
for the whole day.

132
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,930
You don't believe
that he was stalked, do you?

133
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:05,529
Can't you tell
he's pretending to be a victim?

134
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,070
He's done for
once the paternity test comes back.

135
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:11,009
Cha's sponsor story
was just a distraction, right?

136
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,239
Check her bank accounts.

137
00:10:13,979 --> 00:10:16,450
You. Do you have anything
on the necklace brand?

138
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,379
They're still on it.

139
00:10:18,509 --> 00:10:20,019
I'll follow up.

140
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:26,519
(Criminal Investigation)

141
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:42,700
On October 6 at 4:30 p.m.,

142
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,909
what did Cha Eun Sae say
over the phone?

143
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,930
You obnoxious jerk. Listen up.

144
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,399
How's the police reacting
to news of Cha Eun Sae's pregnancy?

145
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,639
What about the interrogation?

146
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,570
They questioned
her older brother Cha Geum Sae.

147
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:52,739
That's it?
They've questioned one guy so far?

148
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,779
Yes.

149
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,379
The police must be...

150
00:11:57,379 --> 00:12:00,519
focusing on the likelihood
that her lover is the killer.

151
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
They haven't
pinpointed anyone, then?

152
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,220
Will you look into
Cha's brother first?

153
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,320
Yes, that's our plan for now.

154
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,519
But he's such a lowlife.

155
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:11,590
There's talk he could be guilty.

156
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,090
That would be just great.

157
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,600
A brother killing his sister
would make for great TV.

158
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,470
Hey, I just remembered something.

159
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:20,070
A month ago, there was talk...

160
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:22,070
that Mo Hyung Taek
was Cha's sponsor.

161
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:24,040
Do you remember hearing that?

162
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,769
That's so undignified.

163
00:12:25,769 --> 00:12:27,909
How dare you repeat such trash?

164
00:12:27,909 --> 00:12:29,479
You went after him once already!

165
00:12:29,479 --> 00:12:31,450
Don't say anything like that again!

166
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:38,190
It's not the first time
I brought up a rumor.

167
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,420
Why overreact?

168
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,229
Mo Hyung Taek's
old enough to be Cha's father.

169
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,159
Isn't it shocking
that she was pregnant?

170
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:47,560
It's not. It's fine
as long as the guy's single.

171
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,029
It's not fine.

172
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,869
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Seol.

173
00:12:50,869 --> 00:12:52,269
What did you bring us?

174
00:12:52,269 --> 00:12:53,940
Something to cheer you up.

175
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,040
- You're busy, right?
- Yes.

176
00:12:56,499 --> 00:12:58,009
- Can you excuse us?
- Sure.

177
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,869
- Follow me.
- Okay.

178
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,440
Bye.

179
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,680
The day Cha Eun Sae died.

180
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,119
Tell me why
you were at Leaders Palace.

181
00:13:12,019 --> 00:13:13,320
Don't say you weren't there.

182
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,389
I have GPS proof
your other phone was there.

183
00:13:16,759 --> 00:13:18,560
- What?
- That day,

184
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,629
you went there
to see Cha, didn't you?

185
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:26,399
I went to a Chinese restaurant
for takeout.

186
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,440
I didn't meet Cha Eun Sae.

187
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,540
The detective must've questioned you
because there's proof you did.

188
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,639
It wasn't that.

189
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,810
Cha Eun Sae...

190
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,149
last talked to me before she died.

191
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,320
What?

192
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,159
- What's wrong? Are you okay?
- Don't touch me.

193
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,259
Mr. Seol.

194
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,560
How are you, sir?

195
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:55,229
Sir, you know writer Seol Woo Jae,
Ms. Seo's husband, right?

196
00:13:55,229 --> 00:13:56,830
Of course, I do.

197
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,629
Not only do you have his looks,

198
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,639
but you have the aura
of your father too.

199
00:14:03,239 --> 00:14:06,440
Were you having a love spat?
Shall we let you get on with it?

200
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,779
No, sir.

201
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:11,080
You should go.
You're late for an appointment.

202
00:14:11,379 --> 00:14:13,149
Yes, I am.

203
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,420
Goodbye, then.

204
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:18,749
Bye.

205
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:28,029
Cha Eun Sae was my stalker.

206
00:14:28,529 --> 00:14:30,100
I'm sure you can gather this much
from the call log.

207
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,229
She kept calling me.
I never called her.

208
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,639
Seol Woo Jae did get takeout.

209
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,540
Nothing on the DNA yet, right?

210
00:14:38,909 --> 00:14:40,739
What bothered you the most
about his interview?

211
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:42,810
That his expression never changed?

212
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,009
"You obnoxious jerk."

213
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,050
I was just imitating Seol Woo Jae.

214
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:52,149
Wrong.

215
00:14:53,859 --> 00:14:55,720
Oh, I got it.

216
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:58,029
That he answered so freely.

217
00:14:58,029 --> 00:15:00,460
As a writer would,
he'd written a scenario.

218
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,499
Wrong.

219
00:15:02,729 --> 00:15:05,029
You should've told me
to get two sets.

220
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:06,430
What is it?

221
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,869
Did you go through her phone?

222
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,479
Did you find anything
to prove that we were lovers?

223
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,040
What about this?

224
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,979
He could've said that
because he had nothing to hide.

225
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,180
What if he had lots to hide,

226
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,749
and he also knew
Cha's phone was missing?

227
00:15:25,389 --> 00:15:27,659
Yes. That's right.

228
00:15:27,659 --> 00:15:30,430
If he were the killer,
he'd have taken her phone.

229
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,960
- What about Cha's accounts?
- Right.

230
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,930
I scoured them.
How can a celebrity's balance be zero?

231
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,769
The credit card company
took 15,000 dollars on the tenth,

232
00:15:38,769 --> 00:15:39,869
and there's zero cents left.

233
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:41,399
Any suspicious deposits
or withdrawals?

234
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,739
Nothing other than
the monthly payments to her brother.

235
00:15:43,739 --> 00:15:44,840
It's squeaky clean.

236
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:48,940
Either they left no record...

237
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,680
or there's no sponsor.
It's one or the other.

238
00:15:56,749 --> 00:15:58,149
Let's play.

239
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:00,519
Thanks.

240
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,359
Here. Your drink.

241
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:24,149
Shoot.

242
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:32,720
Darn it.

243
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:50,369
Screw this.

244
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:03,920
This is driving me insane.

245
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:05,749
Just insane.

246
00:17:07,489 --> 00:17:08,889
You didn't win tonight?

247
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:11,790
I'm Seo Jung Won
from "Nothing Uncovered."

248
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:14,429
Can I interview you outside?

249
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:18,199
You brought a camera?

250
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,540
I have nothing to say.
Leave me alone.

251
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,869
We'll take an in-depth look
at Cha Eun Sae's death.

252
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,209
Your sister died an untimely death.

253
00:17:26,209 --> 00:17:27,909
Shouldn't you have lots to say?

254
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,379
I told you to leave me alone.

255
00:17:32,379 --> 00:17:33,949
What is wrong with you?

256
00:17:35,219 --> 00:17:37,850
Cha Geum Sae's gambling site ID
is "Ten Thousand Percent."

257
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:38,919
Mr. Cha.

258
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:40,959
We're also looking into
gambling sites.

259
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,419
Your sister's death or gambling.

260
00:17:43,419 --> 00:17:45,129
Which episode do you want to be in?

261
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:46,189
What the heck?

262
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,859
Is this an outright threat?

263
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,129
Don't you know
casinos are just for fun?

264
00:17:52,129 --> 00:17:54,369
I'm talking about
illegal gambling sites.

265
00:17:54,369 --> 00:17:55,639
The ID "Ten Thousand Percent."

266
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,669
It's yours, isn't it?

267
00:17:59,409 --> 00:18:02,109
I've dealt with
enough reporters in my time.

268
00:18:02,609 --> 00:18:04,350
Do you take me for a pushover?

269
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:08,219
I know so many people in that field.

270
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,119
Hello?

271
00:18:10,389 --> 00:18:12,219
What? You scratched...

272
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:17,230
Stay where you are,
your head on the ground.

273
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,699
Darn it!

274
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,340
Where is it? Where's the scratch?

275
00:18:31,109 --> 00:18:33,909
Darn it. Where are you?

276
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,510
Screw it.

277
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,879
You just wouldn't pick up.

278
00:18:36,879 --> 00:18:38,750
I thought your phone
was broken but it wasn't.

279
00:18:39,609 --> 00:18:41,550
My gosh.

280
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,790
We got to him first.

281
00:18:45,790 --> 00:18:47,320
My investigation
comes before your interview.

282
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,619
Turn off the camera.
You, get in the car.

283
00:18:49,619 --> 00:18:52,060
What for?
Why should I get in the car?

284
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,500
Are you arresting me or something?

285
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:57,469
Hey!

286
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,000
Don't turn off that thing.
Film this.

287
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,570
I'm the victim's family,
and the detective...

288
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,639
is treating me like a murderer.
Film it all!

289
00:19:04,939 --> 00:19:07,409
What's that thing you want to do?

290
00:19:07,409 --> 00:19:09,639
Tell the viewers the truth, right?

291
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:10,709
Film it all.

292
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:12,280
If you want it all to come out...

293
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,980
Hey. Darn you.

294
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,619
What was that about?

295
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,189
Your sister hit you with her bag,
so you strangled her.

296
00:19:19,189 --> 00:19:20,859
Three days before she died.

297
00:19:21,659 --> 00:19:23,730
The victim was stabbed to death,

298
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,389
and two weeks before that,
you threatened her with a knife.

299
00:19:25,389 --> 00:19:26,859
You don't have an alibi
for the day of the murder either.

300
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:28,199
Gosh. I wonder...

301
00:19:28,199 --> 00:19:30,159
what the viewers will think of you
once this airs on TV.

302
00:19:32,399 --> 00:19:35,169
According to our investigation,
you collected 300,000 dollars...

303
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,699
as the accidental death insurance claim...

304
00:19:36,699 --> 00:19:37,740
on your sister's insurance policy.

305
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:39,369
The gambling debt you owed...

306
00:19:39,369 --> 00:19:41,580
happened to be 300,000 dollars
as well.

307
00:19:41,909 --> 00:19:43,340
Gosh. Unbelievable.

308
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,719
What's your point?

309
00:19:47,949 --> 00:19:50,590
Are you implying that I killed
my own sister to pay back the debt?

310
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,619
Are you writing a novel?

311
00:19:51,619 --> 00:19:54,219
Don't get sidetracked.
Tell me why you choked your sister.

312
00:19:56,159 --> 00:19:58,459
Because she kept making me mad.

313
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,899
Think about how angry
I must've been to choke my sister.

314
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:02,830
Exactly. Why did you get angry?

315
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,399
She went through all this trouble
to become successful.

316
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,699
But she said she was going to retire
and started to act up!

317
00:20:06,699 --> 00:20:08,699
I'm done here.

318
00:20:07,699 --> 00:20:09,469
You couldn't milk her anymore,
so you must've wanted to kill her.

319
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:11,109
I didn't kill her. Darn it!

320
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,240
She already knew that
she was going to die.

321
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,280
What do you mean?

322
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,179
That's what she said
before she died.

323
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,879
She said so many people
were trying to kill her,

324
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:22,020
and one of them was a murderer
or something.

325
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:23,850
- So who is that murderer?
- I have no idea.

326
00:20:24,219 --> 00:20:27,060
I asked her to clarify the nonsense,
but she ignored me to the end.

327
00:20:29,189 --> 00:20:30,219
You know what?

328
00:20:30,790 --> 00:20:32,830
I'm her bereaved family
who deserves compassion!

329
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,359
Not the culprit!

330
00:20:34,830 --> 00:20:36,629
Keep filming. I'm sorry
for yelling at you earlier.

331
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,770
I'm filming.

332
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:41,240
Come and pick up the phone.

333
00:20:44,639 --> 00:20:45,869
Let's stop here for today.

334
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,510
I'll request another meeting
with you later.

335
00:20:48,709 --> 00:20:50,109
Sure. Whatever.

336
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,419
Someone was sponsoring
Cha Eun Sae, right?

337
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,260
What nonsense is that?

338
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:14,000
This is driving me crazy. You know?

339
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:16,540
The detectives are on my case
for not having an alibi.

340
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,040
Seo Jung Won has been harassing me
to air her episode on TV.

341
00:21:19,169 --> 00:21:21,080
Come on. Step on it, you jerk!

342
00:21:21,139 --> 00:21:23,379
As long as your conscience is clear,
there's no problem. Is there?

343
00:21:24,609 --> 00:21:26,550
If you don't trust me
along with the others,

344
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:29,050
I would be greatly disappointed.

345
00:21:32,189 --> 00:21:33,320
Let's meet soon.

346
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:42,399
("Actress Cha Eun Sae
of 'Dating My Ex-Husband' Dead")

347
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,639
You couldn't restore anything
from the phone?

348
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:54,810
The mainboard was completely fried.

349
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:57,149
I tried everything to restore it,
but I couldn't.

350
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,129
Where are you going at this hour?

351
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,699
The police...

352
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,040
collected my DNA,
and the results came out.

353
00:22:26,409 --> 00:22:28,409
Get in.

354
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,030
We're meeting twice in one day.

355
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,040
Tell us the results...

356
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,899
of the DNA comparison test
you ran with my husband's sample.

357
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,280
They weren't a match.

358
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,560
That means
this will be the last time we meet.

359
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,490
I'm not sure.
I get the feeling we'll meet again.

360
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,459
Are you going to stay behind
to talk to him?

361
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:21,199
- Why would I do that?
- In case you had more to discuss.

362
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,869
I heard that you and the detective
knew each other very well.

363
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,369
Not at all.

364
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,740
I thought we were close.
That's why I told you the results.

365
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,010
But from now on,
I must strictly be professional.

366
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:40,679
Now that I'm seeing you together,
I can tell you make a good couple.

367
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,649
What a lovely couple you are.

368
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,310
Alcohol is calling me.

369
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,780
Come on. You were hospitalized
because of cirrhosis.

370
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,020
Tae Heon.
I know that this is pretty lame.

371
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,149
But as you know,

372
00:24:16,149 --> 00:24:17,850
the fact that she had a sponsor
is such personal news.

373
00:24:18,619 --> 00:24:20,790
Did you go through the tabloids
from the financial sector?

374
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:22,659
I thought only a couple of men
would be involved.

375
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:25,260
But at least five men
have been named as her sponsors.

376
00:24:25,959 --> 00:24:27,760
A son of an advertiser,
a movie director,

377
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,800
a middle-aged actor,

378
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,030
the CEO of her former agency,
a lawyer, and an assemblyman.

379
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,070
This is the list.

380
00:24:32,469 --> 00:24:36,070
Here's an interesting fact.
You met one of the men on this list.

381
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,580
Mo Hyung Taek?

382
00:24:50,649 --> 00:24:53,149
Since when and why did you start
carrying a second phone?

383
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:56,590
I had it before we got married.

384
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:59,260
It was tiring
to answer trifling phone calls,

385
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:01,459
So I used it as a cover phone.

386
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:02,899
Why did you hide it from me?

387
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,500
I didn't hide it from you.

388
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,030
I rarely used it,
so I didn't tell you.

389
00:25:07,199 --> 00:25:08,439
I didn't know about it,

390
00:25:08,639 --> 00:25:10,639
but Cha Eun Sae knew
about your second phone.

391
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:12,439
I have no idea
how she found out about it.

392
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,080
This wasn't the only thing.

393
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,679
She knew my plate number
and my office's address.

394
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:21,649
You blocked her number
on your primary phone.

395
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,320
But why didn't you block her number
on your second phone?

396
00:25:29,219 --> 00:25:30,359
She threatened me.

397
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,090
She said she would kill herself
if I blocked her number again.

398
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:35,530
She was more than capable
of doing that.

399
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:38,500
I really had no other choice,
Jung Won.

400
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,669
If you were a victim
and had nothing to hide,

401
00:25:41,869 --> 00:25:43,270
I wonder why
you dumped your second phone.

402
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,409
Because it broke.

403
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,439
What matters here is
the result of the paternity test.

404
00:25:50,879 --> 00:25:52,149
"A hundred pieces
of circumstantial evidence..."

405
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:53,209
"cannot beat
one piece of hard evidence."

406
00:25:53,949 --> 00:25:55,250
That's your motto, isn't it?

407
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,260
I went to my office
after the interview yesterday...

408
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,290
and thought about this.

409
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,330
The day before she died,

410
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:06,030
she told you
she and I were in a relationship.

411
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,359
When I heard that,
I thought she might've done that...

412
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:09,129
because she was
abnormally obsessed with me.

413
00:26:09,459 --> 00:26:11,830
But why did it have to be on the day
you and I went to the building?

414
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:14,500
On top of that, why was she murdered
right after calling me?

415
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,869
I really don't understand
why it had to be...

416
00:26:17,869 --> 00:26:19,869
at that moment on that day.

417
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:22,109
Am I the only one
who finds this suspicious?

418
00:26:22,109 --> 00:26:23,139
Don't you find it suspicious?

419
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:26,149
It's more natural to speculate...

420
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:29,580
that this was all set up
and that someone is after me or you.

421
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,820
That person must be the culprit,
right?

422
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,159
Both of us should think closely...

423
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:41,030
to see if there's anyone
who might want to do that to us.

426

Wait. Did you have
an appointment today?

427
00:27:16,129 --> 00:27:18,070
I'm here about Cha Eun Sae's case.

428
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,070
Could I talk to you outside
for five minutes?

429
00:27:29,639 --> 00:27:32,580
I could have ended up
at the murder scene that day.

430
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,850
Oh, that.

431
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:37,250
I was supposed to type
Unit 1201, not Unit 1401.

432
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,550
I really don't know
how I made that mistake.

433
00:27:38,689 --> 00:27:41,520
You sent the message that day
with your phone, didn't you?

434
00:27:41,859 --> 00:27:43,119
No, I sent it through my computer.

435
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:47,129
I sent the correct unit number
to all the other patients that day,

436
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:50,969
but I don't know
how only you ended up...

437

Do you have anything to say
to your wife, Seo Jung Won,

481
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:46,209
regarding Cha Eun Sae's matter?

482
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:11,869
He's not here.

483
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,669
Are you sure
this is the right place?

484
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,600
Yes, that's the place.

485
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:18,109
I'll call again.

486
00:31:30,649 --> 00:31:31,750
I'm sorry.

487
00:31:38,629 --> 00:31:39,689
Hey!

488
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,300
You!

489
00:32:15,959 --> 00:32:17,000
Are you okay?

490
00:32:38,149 --> 00:32:40,149
No, wait!

491
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:41,149
You tipped Reporter Hwang off,

492
00:32:40,149 --> 00:32:41,189
- didn't you?
- No.

493
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,359
I swear it wasn't me.

494
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:44,929
Where is the photo you sold
to Reporter Hwang?

495
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,429
My laptop.

496
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,169
Open the file.

497
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:04,580
How could you do this to me?
I've known you for years.

498
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:08,149
Well, I got caught red-handed
by your husband.

499
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,189
What do you mean by my husband?

500
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,139
What?

501
00:33:32,139 --> 00:33:33,340
Delete it.

502
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,480
Did my wife order you to do it?

503
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,109
Yes.

504
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:44,379
This should be more than enough
to destroy...

505
00:33:44,919 --> 00:33:46,320
the mainboard completely.

506
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:50,320
After you're done, let my wife know.

507
00:33:52,090 --> 00:33:54,389
Know that restoring it
is impossible.

508
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,929
(Delete the data?)

509
00:34:28,529 --> 00:34:31,429
Get your act together.

510
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:49,719
What do you think, honey?

511
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,049
Who suits the necklace more?
Is it me or Seo Jung Won?

512
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,130
Let's only talk about us
when it's just the two of us.

513
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,670
I am Cha Eun Sae
of "Nothing Uncovered."

514
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,670
Today, I'm going to uncover
the sexy novelist...

515
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:13,969
Seol Woo Jae.

516
00:35:15,009 --> 00:35:18,279
Why does he make women
grow impatient?

517
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,520
Why can't that woman and I come...

518
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,819
to our senses?

519
00:35:27,619 --> 00:35:29,020
Tell us one by one.

520
00:35:30,690 --> 00:35:32,190
Only that part was the same.

521
00:35:33,029 --> 00:35:34,089
The last part.

522
00:35:42,699 --> 00:35:43,739
Really?

523
00:35:47,909 --> 00:35:48,940
Gosh.

524
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,750
Should I stop?

525
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,699
I love you, Eun Sae.

526
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,219
(My Husband)

527
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:39,690
Hey, you saw the article, right?

528
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,130
- I did.
- I'm sorry to put you in the spot.

529
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,630
I'll explain the photo later.

530
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,799
With today's false report,
what has become clear is that...

531
00:36:52,869 --> 00:36:56,040
someone is trying to set us up
using Cha Eun Sae's case.

532
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:08,560
What is it?

533
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,360
It's just strangely absurd.

534
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:15,199
I'll see you later.

535
00:37:59,969 --> 00:38:01,940
(Novelist Seol Woo Jae denies dating
the late Cha Eun Sae)

536
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,310
I only love my wife.

537
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,049
And I'll only love her...

538
00:38:09,549 --> 00:38:11,179
until my last breath.

539
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,589
(Novelist Seol Woo Jae's Interview)

540
00:38:13,589 --> 00:38:14,960
(Seol Woo Jae denies his affair.)

541
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,920
(He will only love his wife
until his last breath.)

542
00:38:36,279 --> 00:38:38,279
Woo Jae.

543
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,080
Woo Jae.

544
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:44,850
I told your wife everything.

545
00:38:45,449 --> 00:38:47,850
Next, I'll tell the press.

546
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:53,190
You can't get away
from me now, honey.

547
00:38:54,759 --> 00:38:56,759
I love you.

548
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:35,639
Are you out of your mind?
Don't you see the lights?

549
00:39:35,739 --> 00:39:37,299
What's wrong with you?

550
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,350
The person you have reached is...

551
00:40:02,659 --> 00:40:05,000
I was watching for a while.
You're slow to catch on.

552
00:40:06,699 --> 00:40:08,000
Is this some kind of...

553
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,339
surveillance?

554
00:40:10,639 --> 00:40:11,739
I was just looking.

555
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,509
And wondering
why you're the mess you are.

556
00:40:16,279 --> 00:40:18,750
"Was this loser always like this?"

557
00:40:19,679 --> 00:40:20,850
That's all.

558
00:40:22,650 --> 00:40:23,719
You have...

559
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,549
a twisted mind.

560
00:40:28,290 --> 00:40:30,259
It's better than having
a twisted character.

561
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:33,730
You punk.

562
00:40:34,259 --> 00:40:36,900
You called your lover a stalker
because the dead can't talk?

563
00:40:38,429 --> 00:40:40,969
You say that even after...

564
00:40:41,469 --> 00:40:43,170
you saw the DNA results?

565
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:44,699
A video of you sleeping with her.

566
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,639
I have it.

567
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,110
So does Ms. Seo.

568
00:40:50,279 --> 00:40:53,150
Your wife saw that video.

569
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,250
"I love you, Eun Sae?"

570
00:41:13,529 --> 00:41:15,369
You'll spend more time with me soon.

571
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,569
As a suspect.

572
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:32,790
Detective.

573
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:41,529
There's something I didn't tell you.

574
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:26,940
Jung Won.

575
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,080
Stop it.

576
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,480
Let go!

577
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,020
You had an opportunity.

578
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:44,819
If you'd admitted to the affair
when I found your other phone,

579
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,929
it wouldn't have come to this.

580
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,270
You slept with a woman
imitating your wife in your studio.

581
00:42:52,730 --> 00:42:54,270
You whispered you loved her.

582
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,969
And she stalked you?

583
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:00,210
You son of a witch.

584
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:01,880
It's true that she stalked me.

585
00:43:03,139 --> 00:43:05,049
I rejected her, but she kept on...

586
00:43:05,049 --> 00:43:06,810
So how many times
did you sleep with her?

587
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,880
Did you enjoy it?
How different was she from me?

588
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,290
What?

589
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,020
You don't want to hear it?

590
00:43:16,759 --> 00:43:17,790
Does it hurt?

591
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,330
Could you hurt more than me?

592
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,489
Calm down and...

593
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,400
If I hadn't seen
that disgusting video,

594
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,469
you'd have lied to me forever.

595
00:43:28,600 --> 00:43:30,170
You almost had me.

596
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,670
You must think it's such a shame.

597
00:43:32,739 --> 00:43:34,270
- Jung Won.
- What?

598
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:39,350
Did you like her that much?

599
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,420
Why did you like her?
What was it about her?

600
00:43:43,449 --> 00:43:45,520
Tell me. I want an answer!

601
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:57,400
She hungered for love.

602
00:43:58,799 --> 00:44:01,069
I felt sorry that she was
tormented with loneliness.

603
00:44:02,699 --> 00:44:03,969
She reminded me of myself.

604
00:44:07,270 --> 00:44:08,610
You call that an excuse?

605
00:44:08,639 --> 00:44:12,110
From the moment I pursued you
and up until now,

606
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,150
as much as I loved you...

607
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,960
I never felt loved back.

608
00:44:24,819 --> 00:44:26,860
Gratitude and comfort. That was it.

609
00:44:36,139 --> 00:44:38,100
We got married
because I loved you more,

610
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:41,170
but I wanted to be noticed
and loved too.

611
00:44:41,409 --> 00:44:43,409
"Let's not expect too much.
Let's not yearn for more."

612
00:44:43,409 --> 00:44:44,839
I told myself that, but it was hard.

613
00:44:45,679 --> 00:44:47,210
You only care about your job,

614
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:49,049
and you don't know
how lonely that makes me feel.

615
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:55,420
Yes.

616
00:44:55,589 --> 00:44:57,159
I'm swamped with work,

617
00:44:57,790 --> 00:44:58,989
and I can't express myself.

618
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,889
Let's say
you're right about all that.

619
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,100
So what?
Is it my fault you had an affair?

620
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:11,639
Cha Eun Sae.

621
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:13,540
You killed her, didn't you?

622
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,460
He went into the building then,

623
00:45:30,819 --> 00:45:33,830
and left at around 9 p.m. which is when
the motorcycle's camera filmed him?

624
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:35,230
Yes.

625
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:38,400
The motorcyclist found it
and asked me to give this to you.

626
00:45:39,230 --> 00:45:40,270
Thanks.

627
00:45:52,179 --> 00:45:54,150
I have an alibi
for Eun Sae's time of death.

628
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:56,150
I told the detective what it was.

629
00:45:56,279 --> 00:45:57,650
So what if you have an alibi?

630
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:00,949
Did you hire someone
to kill her for you?

631
00:46:01,319 --> 00:46:03,319
What?

632
00:46:03,319 --> 00:46:04,860
You brought it up...

633
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,989
by saying someone
was trying to frame us.

634
00:46:10,799 --> 00:46:12,730
I know you're upset,
but don't cross the line.

635
00:46:12,730 --> 00:46:14,369
You crossed the line first.

636
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:16,440
You kept on lying.

637
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,670
Because of you,
my dream is shattered!

638
00:46:22,909 --> 00:46:24,080
To me,

639
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:27,409
you're the prime suspect
of Cha Eun Sae's murder.

640
00:46:30,150 --> 00:46:31,219
Jung Won.

641
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,589
You're not thinking straight.

642
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,860
You got that right.

643
00:46:36,690 --> 00:46:38,460
Now watch how far...

644
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,230

He acts so different here.

Why was Seol so angry that day?

648
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:03,520
I was rude to him.

649
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,080
However rude you were,

650
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,119
this kind of disturbance
is an obstruction of business.

651

Why didn't you report him?

Excuse me.

653
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:14,589
I told him not to report it.

He came back the next day
and apologized profusely.

I didn't think
we'd meet again like this.

Ms. Jin's death, right?

she was going to use for this house
after moving in.

665

She said her passcode was going
to be the same as her lover's.

You are indeed Eun Sae's lover.

Should I round up all the reporters
including your wife...

671
00:50:27,489 --> 00:50:29,319
and hold a press conference?

672
00:50:29,719 --> 00:50:31,190
I'll tell them you were her lover...

673

because she was pregnant. Darn it.

as an adulterer and a murderer,

that I stay quiet.

Darn it.

680

Forget about money.

681
00:51:06,989 --> 00:51:09,029
This is a much easier way
to keep you quiet.

Go ahead.

You see, Eun Sae relied on me a lot.

Is that so?

687
00:51:33,219 --> 00:51:34,619
She trusted me to the point
that she asked me...

688
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:36,360
to hold onto the evidence photos
that proved you beat her.

689
00:51:38,489 --> 00:51:40,360
What would happen if I were
to disclose these photos...

690
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,630
and the medical certificate
to the public?

"He constantly beat his sister up
for money."

692
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,830
"In the end, he killed her."
Wouldn't they suspect that?

693

Hey.

Shut your mouth, you murderer.

Did you know I was the last person
she called before she died?

She said she had to hang up
because you had arrived.

That's why...

698
00:52:02,850 --> 00:52:04,420
I thought you were the murderer.

00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,960
You must have lost your mind,
you scumbag.

really not kill her?

He was with a woman.

That's why he didn't disclose...

- his alibi right away.
- Pardon?

Who is this woman?

708

A woman he doesn't want
Seo Jung Won and me to find out.

709
00:53:01,739 --> 00:53:03,080
He was seeing another woman?

They've figured out the brand
of the necklace Cha Eun Sae was holding.

712
00:53:10,250 --> 00:53:11,779
It's from Harry Joyce,
the luxury brand.

So they don't sell men's necklaces,
right?

718
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,130
Then it's highly likely
that the culprit is a woman.

at presenting the 9 p.m. news,

After the article
about my husband got published,

727

I needed time to check some facts.

My husband did have an affair.

He did have an affair.

But he wasn't the father
of Cha Eun Sae's baby.

with the paternity test.

do you think they will accept it?

The viewers want me, his wife,
not just a random reporter,

Instead of defending your husband,

760
00:54:58,619 --> 00:55:01,690
you will be a reporter who uncovers
the dirty secrets of your husband?

at all how she looked like.

No. He was charged
as an accessory to murder.

One of his believers died
from a seizure in his presence.

789

He didn't even call 911.
He neglected his believer and left.

Gosh. He's a total psychopath.

00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,230
I totally knew
you'd suffer like this all alone.

805
00:58:32,670 --> 00:58:34,670
Try to snap out of it, okay?

806
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,139
I want to,

807
00:58:38,639 --> 00:58:40,110
but it's not as easy as I thought.

808
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:45,619
You had a hallucination
and saw blood on your hands?

809
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,319
Could it be connected to how you witnessed
the dead body a month ago?

810
00:58:52,830 --> 00:58:54,029
Yes, I think so.

811
00:58:57,159 --> 00:58:59,029
You must be under a lot of stress.

812
00:59:01,299 --> 00:59:04,199
I read the article
about your husband.

813
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:07,810
I'm really sorry.

814
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,239
The day before she was found dead,

815
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:16,080
Cha Eun Sae said to me...

816
00:59:18,420 --> 00:59:20,089
that she and my husband
were in love.

817
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:23,920
- I see.
- That day,

818
00:59:25,219 --> 00:59:26,290
I wanted...

819
00:59:29,290 --> 00:59:30,699
to kill Cha Eun Sae.

820
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,699
From her death...

821
00:59:34,429 --> 00:59:35,600
to how my husband betrayed me,

822
00:59:39,139 --> 00:59:40,409
it all feels like a nightmare.

823
00:59:41,610 --> 00:59:44,239
Because you loved
and trusted your husband,

824
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:47,179
this is too painful for you.
It's only natural.

825
00:59:48,750 --> 00:59:49,850
Before I met my husband,

826
00:59:51,319 --> 00:59:52,750
I was always alone.

827
00:59:54,049 --> 00:59:55,190
He became my parent, sibling,

828
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:58,619
and friend. No, more than that.

829
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:01,290
That was how much I trusted him,

830
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:06,900
and I thought
he'd always be on my side.

831
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,670
When you feel depressed
or angry, try not to suppress it.

832
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:14,639
It's healthier
to express your feelings.

833
01:00:17,610 --> 01:00:19,810
He said
he had never felt loved by me.

834
01:00:20,949 --> 01:00:22,009
He said he was lonely.

835
01:00:22,449 --> 01:00:24,219
He blamed it all on me.

836
01:00:25,150 --> 01:00:26,250
That jerk...

837
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:29,520
I won't suppress it.

838
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:33,730
The pain he gave me.
This humiliation.

839
01:00:35,089 --> 01:00:36,600
I'll make sure he gets it all back.

840
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:15,830
There are slight defense wounds
on her arm.

841
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:18,869
Cha Eun Sae once told me
about her sponsor.

842
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,440
Mo Hyung Taek?

843
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,569
They've figured out the brand
of the necklace Cha Eun Sae was holding.

844
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:24,040
I only see women's necklaces.

845
01:01:24,179 --> 01:01:25,710
So they don't sell men's necklaces,
right?

846
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:27,449
That's what she said
before she died.

847
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:30,119
She said so many people
were trying to kill her,

848
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,949
and one of them was a murderer
or something.

849
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:33,889
Then it's highly likely
that the culprit is a woman.

850
01:01:42,159 --> 01:01:45,330
(Leaders Palace)

851
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:14,529
Ms. Seo Jung Won.

852
01:02:15,029 --> 01:02:16,560
You'll need to come with me...

853
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:18,799
to Gangha Police Station.

854
01:02:19,460 --> 01:02:20,529
Me? Why?

855
01:02:21,600 --> 01:02:22,630
Because of my husband?

856
01:02:22,630 --> 01:02:24,569
We must interview you.

857
01:02:47,230 --> 01:02:48,730
You brought me here, so talk.

858
01:02:52,759 --> 01:02:54,170
You've seen this necklace before,
right?

859
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:00,610
I found a picture of you doing
an interview wearing this necklace.

860
01:03:05,409 --> 01:03:07,750
I do have the same necklace.

861
01:03:08,350 --> 01:03:10,250
Didn't you lose your necklace?

862
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:13,549
How do you know that?

863
01:03:14,190 --> 01:03:15,719
Because this necklace is yours.

864
01:03:17,790 --> 01:03:20,290
- Sorry?
- Your necklace...

865
01:03:21,029 --> 01:03:22,690
was found at the scene...

866
01:03:24,429 --> 01:03:25,500
of Cha Eun Sae's murder.

867
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,940
Ms. Seo Jung Won.

868
01:03:31,869 --> 01:03:33,440
The day Cha Eun Sae was found dead,

869
01:03:34,810 --> 01:03:36,380
were you...

870
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:38,509
at the scene?

871
01:04:11,750 --> 01:04:13,750
MK DORAMAS
