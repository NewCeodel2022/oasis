00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,417
Aunt, Uncle!

5
00:00:18,417 --> 00:00:20,387
You'd better not forget your promise.

6
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,347
Of course! Don't worry.

7
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:23,907
That's right.

8
00:00:23,907 --> 00:00:27,377
We moved our office, Jung Shin. Okay?

9
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:29,337
Stop by when you come to Seoul.

10
00:00:29,337 --> 00:00:32,157
I will treat you to Chinese food, your favorite.

11
00:00:38,807 --> 00:00:40,057
Honey.

12
00:00:40,057 --> 00:00:43,167
Isn't everything working out too well for us these days?

13
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:44,707
I'm getting a bit scared

14
00:00:44,707 --> 00:00:47,107
that we might become chaebol.

15
00:00:47,107 --> 00:00:49,627
Don't get scared!

16
00:00:49,627 --> 00:00:52,007
Don't you remember what that fortune teller at Miari said?

17
00:00:52,007 --> 00:00:56,287
Around this time, there will be a big change in our lives.

Hey, Ms. Oh!

22
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,267
Give me some alcohol, Yang Ja.

23
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,717
Did you fight again with your aunt?

24
00:01:50,007 --> 00:01:53,057
Should I introduce you to some rich old man?

25
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:54,897
So you could keep your theater?

26
00:01:54,897 --> 00:01:57,457
You don't have a rich young man?

27
00:01:57,457 --> 00:02:00,057
Would young men look for you?

28
00:02:00,057 --> 00:02:01,807
They would look for me.

29
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:03,437
Yeah, right!

30
00:02:05,317 --> 00:02:09,307
You said that you had an aunt who runs a theater in Gwangju, right?

31
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,847
Yeah, my mom's cousin.

32
00:02:10,847 --> 00:02:12,017
What's her name?

33
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:14,267
Aunt Geum Ok. Cha Geum Ok.

34
00:02:15,137 --> 00:02:19,207
I heard my aunt is the only woman in the movie promotion industry in our country.

35
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,057
Even my mom and dad can't do anything in front of her.

36
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,487
<i>What's the deal with this little girl?</i>

37
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:23,897
<i>Who are you, Ahjumma?</i>

38

<i>If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of this.</i>

39

<i>Oh, you're the daughter of Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?</i>

40
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:37,337
But how do you know my aunt?

41
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,917
The Commander,

42
00:02:41,647 --> 00:02:43,747
I mean, the Deputy Director

43
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:46,477
was worried a lot about

44
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:48,067
whether you had any difficulties while moving.

45
00:02:49,117 --> 00:02:50,677
I see.

46
00:02:50,677 --> 00:02:53,417
But what do you mean by "Deputy Director"?

47
00:02:53,417 --> 00:02:55,237
I heard he was leaving the military.

48
00:02:55,237 --> 00:02:57,447
Did he already move somewhere else?

49
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:00,387
Oh, yes. He went to Namsan.

50
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:02,487
If it's Namsan,

51
00:03:03,537 --> 00:03:06,727
then isn't that a major promotion?

52
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:09,467
We've already prepared a place for you to stay in Seoul.

53
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:12,387
If you have anything else you need, let me know.

54
00:03:12,387 --> 00:03:15,017
No, thank you so much.

55
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,847
Do you...

56
00:03:20,847 --> 00:03:23,047
have something you're worried about?

57
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:25,687
No.

58
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:29,657
I left a message for my son in Seoul,

59
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:31,977
and I was wondering if he would come.

60
00:03:31,977 --> 00:03:35,817
Wouldn't he come since his mother is moving to Seoul?

61
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,497
He would, right?

62
00:03:52,157 --> 00:03:54,257
How is it? Do you like it?

63
00:03:54,987 --> 00:03:56,297
Yes.

64
00:03:56,297 --> 00:03:59,747
Thanks to you, I was able to get such a nice house for less than the market price.

65
00:03:59,747 --> 00:04:01,717
Thank you so much.

66
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:04,207
I guess Cheol Woong hasn't come yet?

67
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:08,547
He said he would stay at his own place for the time being.

68
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,917
His school is a bit far from here.

69
00:04:12,037 --> 00:04:16,107
I was going to properly introduce him to you, Oppa.

70
00:04:16,187 --> 00:04:18,387
I'm sure I'll get to meet him soon.

71
00:04:18,417 --> 00:04:21,957
But more importantly, shouldn't you also get a job, Yeo Jin?

72
00:04:21,987 --> 00:04:24,667
It would be a shame to let your degree at a prestigious university go to waste.

73
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,157
That was such a long time ago.

74
00:04:27,157 --> 00:04:30,437
I happen to have a job I want to recommend to you.

75
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,347
Do you want to hear about it?

76
00:04:42,637 --> 00:04:45,477
Hey, you, wake up!

77
00:04:45,477 --> 00:04:47,467
I said wake up!

78
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:53,307
What are you doing on a morning like this?

79
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,547
In front of the sacred theater!

80
00:04:56,507 --> 00:04:58,987
You must have taken an early morning train.

81
00:04:58,987 --> 00:05:01,117
To pay the balance already?

82
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:03,417
O-Oh... well, not really...

83
00:05:04,817 --> 00:05:07,177
Ma'am, how about a daytime drink...

84
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:08,667
I mean...

85
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,477
how about having a hangover drink with me?

86
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:13,387
This is...

87
00:05:13,387 --> 00:05:17,287
a cognac that I worked hard to obtain.

88
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:20,837
Do you think there will be a pub that opens in the morning?

89
00:05:23,877 --> 00:05:26,377
There's no need to go far.

90
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:48,277
You're telling me to buy Namhae Theater?

91
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:49,557
Yes.

92
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:51,787
I owe the bank about 70 million won,

93
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:53,687
and there are some other debts.

94
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:56,837
Please buy the theater with those debts included.

95
00:05:56,837 --> 00:05:58,497
If I pay off your debt,

96
00:05:58,497 --> 00:06:01,237
are you saying you will sell the theater for cheap?

97
00:06:02,717 --> 00:06:03,857
Yes.

98
00:06:04,707 --> 00:06:06,087
Why?

99
00:06:07,487 --> 00:06:10,567
Although I couldn't keep my promise,

100
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,197
you trusted me.

101
00:06:13,197 --> 00:06:14,527
Also,

102
00:06:15,387 --> 00:06:18,007
I feel like if I said I would buy the theater back later,

103
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:20,077
you would be someone who'd return it to me.

104
00:06:23,727 --> 00:06:25,667
This young girl

105
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:29,227
is talking like all she ate was conniving snakes for food.

106
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:33,307
I don't do business that comes at a loss for me.

107
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:43,377
In "The Godfather,"

108
00:06:43,377 --> 00:06:46,057
Vito Corleone says this line.

109
00:06:46,867 --> 00:06:48,457
"I'm gonna make him

110
00:06:48,457 --> 00:06:51,947
an offer he can't refuse."

111
00:06:51,947 --> 00:06:53,887
Honestly, the theater is just a sweetener.

112
00:06:53,887 --> 00:06:55,937
I'm the real deal.

113
00:06:55,937 --> 00:06:58,027
I will sell myself to you, Ma'am.

114
00:07:04,977 --> 00:07:08,107
Whoa, you're a tough cookie, aren't you?

115
00:07:08,107 --> 00:07:09,377
What are you worth?

116
00:07:09,377 --> 00:07:13,487
I know you are not satisfied with being an entertainment promoter just in Jeolla-do.

117
00:07:13,487 --> 00:07:16,317
You should become a promoter who dominates the entire country.

118
00:07:17,767 --> 00:07:19,627
I will help you with that.

119
00:07:24,257 --> 00:07:26,017
Hey,

120
00:07:26,017 --> 00:07:27,917
it does seem like

121
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:30,467
you watched a lot of movies.

122
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:41,417
Since you made your offer like in the movies,

123
00:07:41,417 --> 00:07:44,537
I will respond to you very realistically.

124
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,857
Get lost.

125
00:07:51,857 --> 00:07:54,057
Thanks for the drink.

Ma'am!

Ma'am!

129
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:14,387
I refused an offer that I couldn't refuse.

130
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:16,657
So you have more to say to me?

131
00:08:18,717 --> 00:08:20,777
I'm sorry.

132
00:08:21,687 --> 00:08:22,837
About what?

133
00:08:23,547 --> 00:08:25,807
I was arrogant.

134
00:08:25,807 --> 00:08:28,407
You can make the offer. I will do whatever it is.

135
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:29,847
Oh, really?

136
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,457
Then, for me,

137
00:08:32,457 --> 00:08:37,257
I will make you an offer that you can refuse. Okay?

138
00:08:37,257 --> 00:08:38,487
But...

139
00:08:39,397 --> 00:08:42,687
you should hear my offer on your knees.

140
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:53,247
Here?

141
00:08:54,217 --> 00:08:56,147
You can refuse.

142
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:15,037
Please tell me.

143
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,517
First,

144
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:20,407
I will pay off your debt and take over your theater.

145
00:09:20,407 --> 00:09:22,577
When the right time comes.

146
00:09:22,577 --> 00:09:24,057
Second,

147
00:09:24,057 --> 00:09:26,437
you will work under me

148
00:09:26,437 --> 00:09:28,177
as a maid.

149
00:09:32,307 --> 00:09:35,127
I said you can refuse.

150
00:09:52,977 --> 00:09:54,897
I'll do it!

M-Mom...

154
00:10:31,987 --> 00:10:33,367
Come out.

155
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:43,247
I heard you haven't been to the boarding home for the past few days.

156
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:47,177
And you didn't visit me when I moved to Seoul, either.

157
00:10:47,177 --> 00:10:48,777
I'm sorry.

158
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:51,897
If you've done that much, you've done enough.

159
00:10:51,897 --> 00:10:54,447
You even got dragged into military service.

160
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:58,467
Stop with the protests

161
00:10:58,467 --> 00:10:59,997
and study for the bar exam.

162
00:11:01,187 --> 00:11:04,357
You say the same thing that Doo Hak hyung said to me.

163
00:11:04,357 --> 00:11:06,147
You met Doo Hak?

164
00:11:06,147 --> 00:11:07,387
Yes.

165
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:10,417
How is he doing?

166
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:13,487
I don't know.

167
00:11:13,487 --> 00:11:17,097
It just seems like he's changed a bit.

We decided to go our own way. Isn't that right?

Give me what you got, too.

Okay.

I mean, they were in and out of jail from their youth

so none of them went to military service.

I couldn't tell you in advance because you were away.

You first take on a job and then report to me after?

Gosh, it hasn't been that long since you came out of prison,

498
00:28:25,185 --> 00:28:26,765
but seeing how handsome you look...

499
00:28:26,765 --> 00:28:29,535
It's like you're a Seoul person.

500
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:30,875
Really?

501
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:35,555
- Oh, right.
 - Oppa, I ended up working at a factory in Seoul.

Then what about school?

00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:45,365
Oppa, you know, too, right?

507
00:28:45,365 --> 00:28:47,645
I wasn't on your level,

508
00:28:47,645 --> 00:28:50,135
but I was at least in the top five in my class.

509
00:28:50,205 --> 00:28:55,105
But these girls who are worse at studying than me are all going to high school,

510
00:28:55,105 --> 00:28:59,405
but Father kept telling me to quit school and work at a factory...

511
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:02,485

Do you know why I said I would go to the factory without making a fuss?

514

So that I can go back to school by earning my own money!

You resented your father a lot, right?

522
00:29:33,965 --> 00:29:36,645
I resented him a lot, too.

523
00:29:36,645 --> 00:29:42,915
I thought how heartless your father was, not visiting his son in prison once.

If you're going to talk about Father, just stop.

When you turned 20 and transferred to Gwangju,

526
00:29:50,985 --> 00:29:53,315
that was the day before Chuseok*.
(Harvest Day in Korea, holiday similar to Thanksgiving)

527
00:29:53,315 --> 00:29:59,415
But out of the blue, your father said he'll go to a cousin's house in Gwangyang to offer ancestral rites.

528
00:29:59,415 --> 00:30:03,155
I didn't want to bother with preparing food for the ancestral rites, so I told him to go ahead.

529
00:30:03,155 --> 00:30:04,785
Mom.

530
00:30:04,805 --> 00:30:06,545
Just hurry inside and go to bed.

531
00:30:07,525 --> 00:30:09,905
You don't want to hear it?

532
00:30:09,905 --> 00:30:11,355
Yes.

533
00:30:12,675 --> 00:30:15,265
Still, listen.

534
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:26,665
But after telling me he would return around Chuseok evening,

535
00:30:26,665 --> 00:30:30,105
he didn't return even when it became the day after Chuseok.

536
00:30:30,105 --> 00:30:34,505
I wondered if something had happened, so I called his cousin in Gwangyang,

537
00:30:34,505 --> 00:30:35,835
and he said, "What are you talking about?"

538
00:30:35,835 --> 00:30:38,405
He said your father never came.

539
00:30:40,215 --> 00:30:43,145
I was so scared.

540
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:45,315
I couldn't sleep at all

541
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:48,125
and couldn't even eat anything.

542
00:30:48,125 --> 00:30:50,045
It was only after two days

00:38:33,045 --> 00:38:35,775
already love this country.

657
00:38:37,985 --> 00:38:41,245
You know very well that's not what my question means.

658
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:43,545
I don't really know...

659
00:38:43,545 --> 00:38:44,985
what you mean.

660
00:38:44,985 --> 00:38:46,475
You don't know?

661
00:38:47,735 --> 00:38:49,875
It's simply what I said. "Loving your country."

662
00:38:49,875 --> 00:38:51,515
How do you love your country?

663
00:38:51,515 --> 00:38:53,945
It's catching spies and commies.

664
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:57,215
If you find and report commies,

665
00:38:57,215 --> 00:39:00,625
we arrest those assholes and boost national security.

666
00:39:01,485 --> 00:39:02,895
Are you...

667
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:04,995
asking me to be a mole?

668
00:39:04,995 --> 00:39:06,575
What do you mean, mole?

669
00:39:07,505 --> 00:39:09,105
That's what...

670
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:10,945
we call a patriot.

671
00:39:11,775 --> 00:39:13,145
Loving your country.

672
00:39:14,905 --> 00:39:16,885
This is the frontline.

673
00:39:17,765 --> 00:39:20,045
It's a very dangerous place.

674
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:24,615
No one will know

675
00:39:24,615 --> 00:39:26,585
even if you disappear.

676
00:39:29,355 --> 00:39:30,795
Choi Cheol Woong.

677
00:39:34,485 --> 00:39:37,155
I'm giving you an  opportunity right now.

678
00:39:39,175 --> 00:39:42,705
Don't you need to continue your patriotic family lineage?

679
00:39:47,265 --> 00:39:48,885
I don't want to.

680
00:40:03,755 --> 00:40:05,155
Write it.

681
00:40:06,135 --> 00:40:08,085
Hey, put him through one more run.

682
00:40:20,535 --> 00:40:22,995
I'll write it! I will!

683
00:40:24,055 --> 00:40:25,425
I'll write it...

684
00:40:36,515 --> 00:40:38,565
- Hey, Hyung!
- What happened!

685
00:40:38,565 --> 00:40:39,865
- What's this?
- How?

686
00:40:39,865 --> 00:40:41,025
What the heck?

687
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:45,295
- What happened?
- You didn't get hurt? Are you okay?

688
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,105
Come on!

689
00:40:47,105 --> 00:40:50,375
♫ <i>The life running...</i> ♫

690
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:53,125
Right now is the time to make our stand.

691
00:40:53,125 --> 00:40:54,895
Yes, right now is the time.

692
00:40:54,895 --> 00:40:57,785
I said we couldn't. Everyone got arrested.

693
00:40:59,235 --> 00:41:00,635
When will it be if not now?

694
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,235
Hyung!

695
00:41:02,235 --> 00:41:04,205
Why did you come back here? It's dangerous!

696
00:41:04,205 --> 00:41:05,325
You're here?

697
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:06,655
I'm sorry for making you all suffer.

698
00:41:06,655 --> 00:41:09,385
We worried so much because of the cops.

699
00:41:09,385 --> 00:41:10,965
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

700
00:41:10,965 --> 00:41:12,015
Let's sit.

701
00:41:12,825 --> 00:41:15,215
By the way, what brings you here?

702
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:17,325
I need to at least see your faces before I go.

703
00:41:17,325 --> 00:41:18,845
Are you okay?

704
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:20,335
Have some of this, too.

705
00:41:20,335 --> 00:41:21,855
Where are you headed?

706
00:41:22,815 --> 00:41:23,985
You know him, right?

707
00:41:24,815 --> 00:41:26,275
I know you do!

708
00:41:38,075 --> 00:41:39,745
You!

709
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:42,455
You sons of bitches!

710
00:41:47,015 --> 00:41:48,595
"After confirming each other's feelings,

711
00:41:48,595 --> 00:41:51,175
Ju Seok gets Black Glove in the taxi.

712
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,085
Ju Seok and Jun Il transport the luggage from the handcart to the taxi.

713
00:41:54,085 --> 00:41:56,225
The three start to get hopeful.

714
00:41:56,225 --> 00:41:58,895
And the screen fades out."

715
00:41:58,895 --> 00:42:01,195
The scenario ends here.

716
00:42:02,605 --> 00:42:04,805
It's a little dark, huh?

717
00:42:06,125 --> 00:42:08,265
Who's the director again?

718
00:42:08,265 --> 00:42:09,905
It's Bae Chang Ho's debuting work.

719
00:42:09,905 --> 00:42:12,415
Kim Bo Yeon, Ahn Sung Ki, and Kim Hee Ra are the main cast.

720
00:42:12,415 --> 00:42:15,645
I see. It's not bad.

721
00:42:15,645 --> 00:42:18,885
By the way, I'm curious about this one thing, Boss.

722
00:42:18,885 --> 00:42:21,055
It'd be faster for you you to read the scenario yourself,

723
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,965
so why do you always tell me to read it to you?

724
00:42:22,965 --> 00:42:24,235
Didn't you know?

725
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:27,385
I don't know how to read.

726
00:42:28,305 --> 00:42:29,715
What?

727
00:42:29,715 --> 00:42:31,625
You really don't know how to read?

728
00:42:31,625 --> 00:42:33,775
How did you read the ledgers all this time, then?

729
00:42:33,775 --> 00:42:35,475
When did I ever read them?

730
00:42:35,475 --> 00:42:38,475
I just memorize them when my bookkeeper reads them to me.

731
00:42:40,675 --> 00:42:42,945
Whoa, how do you memorize this?

732
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:51,445
The landlord's apparently head over heels for his wife in Japan,

733
00:42:51,445 --> 00:42:53,195
so he doesn't really stay in Korea.

734
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:56,485
It's perfect for us to use!

735
00:43:01,665 --> 00:43:03,905
A total of 200 million won...

736
00:43:03,905 --> 00:43:06,805
- for the production cost?
- That's correct, President Cha.

737
00:43:11,035 --> 00:43:12,965
The work has some level of completion,

738
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:14,005
but it's about the poverty in cities.

739
00:43:14,005 --> 00:43:16,245
So there will be some censorship and correction.

740
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:18,995
It'll also be Rated-R. No underage viewers.

741
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:22,635
So will it make money or not?

742
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,765
If I were you...

743
00:43:27,765 --> 00:43:29,505
I wouldn't invest in it.

744
00:43:32,275 --> 00:43:33,805
In that case...

745
00:43:33,805 --> 00:43:35,515
I'll need to invest in it.

746
00:43:35,515 --> 00:43:36,475
Sorry?

747
00:43:36,475 --> 00:43:38,775
- Why?
- Because...

748
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:42,605
the arrogant smarties are the ones who are always wrong.

749
00:43:44,005 --> 00:43:47,465
Hand him a postdated check for 30 million won.

750
00:43:47,465 --> 00:43:49,725
Dated in a month, okay?

751
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:50,935
Thank you.

752
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:52,235
Thank you, President Cha.

753
00:43:52,235 --> 00:43:54,325
Everyone else was reluctant to invest.

754
00:43:54,325 --> 00:43:55,865
You're...

755
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,485
like an army of support by my side.

756
00:43:58,485 --> 00:44:00,835
I'm not trying to help you.

757
00:44:03,265 --> 00:44:06,485
It's because I smell money here.

758
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:07,735
Sorry?

759
00:44:08,615 --> 00:44:10,115
You smell money?

760
00:44:12,145 --> 00:44:13,715
Whoa...

761
00:44:13,715 --> 00:44:16,645
This building is pretty good.

762
00:44:16,645 --> 00:44:19,055
Since there's info on developments nearby,

763
00:44:19,055 --> 00:44:21,105
we just need to put it up for about 300 million won.

764
00:44:21,105 --> 00:44:25,215
And people will flock like herd dogs.

765
00:44:26,385 --> 00:44:28,105
Whoa, she must be an actress.

766
00:44:28,985 --> 00:44:30,565
She's really pretty.

767
00:44:30,565 --> 00:44:32,775
But who is she?

768
00:44:32,775 --> 00:44:35,555
Boss, do you know her?

769
00:44:35,555 --> 00:44:38,475
Let's leave if you're done looking around.

770
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,055
Just come for a second.

771
00:44:40,055 --> 00:44:42,385
It's because she's really pretty. Come and take a look.

772
00:44:43,325 --> 00:44:46,585
Hurry up. How are you so young and not interested in women?

773
00:44:46,585 --> 00:44:48,075
Go take a look.

774
00:44:49,015 --> 00:44:51,035
For the movie...

775
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:13,485
I was right, huh? Isn't she pretty?

776
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:16,455
She's not pretty at all.

777
00:45:16,455 --> 00:45:18,205
Let's hurry up and go, I said!

778
00:45:19,085 --> 00:45:21,835
He took his sweet time looking.

779
00:45:21,835 --> 00:45:24,095
Our boss has high standards, huh?

780
00:46:04,165 --> 00:46:07,185
You can start living here from now.

781
00:46:07,185 --> 00:46:09,625
Wait—

782
00:46:09,625 --> 00:46:11,365
What's this place for?

783
00:46:11,365 --> 00:46:12,775
Oh, my.

784
00:46:12,775 --> 00:46:15,365
You're really as dense as a rock.

785
00:46:15,365 --> 00:46:17,445
Can't you tell from just looking?

786
00:46:17,445 --> 00:46:20,595
It's Namdo Film Studio's Seoul branch.

787
00:46:20,595 --> 00:46:21,705
Gosh.

788
00:46:21,705 --> 00:46:25,055
There was a dimwit whom I fired about two weeks ago.

789
00:46:25,055 --> 00:46:26,905
So, starting today,

790
00:46:26,905 --> 00:46:29,905
you're the employee and the branch manager at the same time.

791
00:46:30,795 --> 00:46:33,995
Why? You're so out of it since you

792
00:46:33,995 --> 00:46:36,475
got promoted too fast, aren't you?

793
00:46:38,015 --> 00:46:39,135
Sweetie,

794
00:46:39,135 --> 00:46:41,435
buy what you need with this.

795
00:46:51,095 --> 00:46:52,925
Boss!

796
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,965
Boss!

797
00:46:57,965 --> 00:46:59,375
Wait...

798
00:46:59,375 --> 00:47:02,385
you need to tell me what I need to do.

799
00:47:02,385 --> 00:47:05,285
Oh, my. Look at this girl.

800
00:47:05,285 --> 00:47:06,985
How can you be asking me when you

801
00:47:06,985 --> 00:47:10,155
also have run a theater before?

802
00:47:10,155 --> 00:47:13,095
Also, I don't even  know how to read.

803
00:47:13,095 --> 00:47:15,235
And you're a college dropout.

804
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,655
Who'd teach whom?

805
00:47:29,925 --> 00:47:32,435
Aigoo, whatever.

806
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:58,695
Oh Jung Shin, you're the  crazy wench.

807
00:47:58,705 --> 00:48:02,215
How can you make a living when you have no eyes for people?

808
00:48:03,265 --> 00:48:04,775
Gosh.

809
00:48:04,775 --> 00:48:06,605
What are my eyes good for?

810
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,045

00:49:14,855 --> 00:49:16,035
Hey, you!

829
00:49:16,035 --> 00:49:17,705
You better stop prank-calling!

830
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,255
You're an elementary school student, right?

831
00:49:19,255 --> 00:49:21,845
I guess you don't know what a nasty temper I've got.

If you waste another call,

I'll chase you down to the end of the universe and

break your fingers so you can't dial ever again.

Hey! Get them all!

842

Hey!

00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:32,715
Hey, are you okay? Can you move?

846
00:50:32,715 --> 00:50:34,465
I'm okay. You guys go ahead.

847
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,745
Hurry up and go.

848
00:50:35,745 --> 00:50:38,325
I'm okay, so leave me and go!

849
00:50:38,325 --> 00:50:40,625
Stay still!

It's okay.

853
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,165
Sorry?

854
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,845
He's one of us.

855
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:26,255
Sir.

856
00:51:26,255 --> 00:51:27,705
Take care.

857
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:35,265
What's this?

858
00:51:35,265 --> 00:51:36,985
Did you follow me?

859
00:51:36,985 --> 00:51:38,545
Follow you, my ass.

860
00:51:39,505 --> 00:51:41,125
I said you're one of us.

861
00:51:41,125 --> 00:51:43,685
And families protect each other.

862
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:49,585
Gosh, those fellas aren't part of the leadership.

863
00:51:49,585 --> 00:51:51,145
It's just a regular club!

864
00:51:51,145 --> 00:51:53,255
- Okay?
- Okay, I see.

865
00:51:54,205 --> 00:51:55,945
However...

866
00:51:55,945 --> 00:51:59,945
one of them might know the information I want.

867
00:51:59,945 --> 00:52:03,175
So I'm just raking them all in.

868
00:52:04,335 --> 00:52:05,775
Choi Cheol Woong...

869
00:52:05,775 --> 00:52:08,165
I don't need hundreds of small fish.

870
00:52:08,165 --> 00:52:10,085
I just need one big fish.

871
00:52:11,045 --> 00:52:14,505
Wouldn't that also save you some face as well?

872
00:52:16,615 --> 00:52:20,175
I'm sick of showing you this picture, too.

873
00:52:20,175 --> 00:52:22,355
Let's love your country for once!

874
00:52:24,755 --> 00:52:26,185
Love my country?

875
00:52:27,055 --> 00:52:28,325
Okay.

876
00:52:28,325 --> 00:52:31,525
Please let me love my country. Okay?

877
00:52:33,025 --> 00:52:35,255
Just send me back to the army instead

878
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:38,325
and stand guard by the barbed wires!

879
00:52:43,405 --> 00:52:45,805
Have you gone mad?

880
00:52:45,805 --> 00:52:47,665
You want to die, huh?

881
00:52:47,665 --> 00:52:49,995
You talk too much.

882
00:52:53,635 --> 00:52:56,495
If you go back to the army...

883
00:52:56,495 --> 00:52:59,455
you can die without anyone knowing.

884
00:53:00,515 --> 00:53:04,295
No one will ever know how you died or why you died, either.

885
00:53:04,295 --> 00:53:07,265
That's what's called death under suspicious circumstances.

886
00:53:07,265 --> 00:53:11,115
You seem to have gotten a little gutsy now that you socialized a bit.

887
00:53:11,115 --> 00:53:12,825
How about it?

888
00:53:12,825 --> 00:53:15,035
Shall I send you back to the army?

889
00:53:17,625 --> 00:53:20,395
I'm telling you this because you're a family.

890
00:53:20,395 --> 00:53:23,145
Always be grateful, you punk.

891
00:53:26,025 --> 00:53:30,405
The place does have a guard,

892
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:32,415
but he only knows the building manager

893
00:53:32,415 --> 00:53:35,375
and he doesn't know what the landlord looks like!

894
00:53:35,375 --> 00:53:36,665
What?

895
00:53:36,665 --> 00:53:38,455
Whoa, the heavens are helping!

896
00:53:38,455 --> 00:53:41,125
Whoa, isn't this such a good deal?

897
00:53:41,125 --> 00:53:44,195
How much do you think we can get for this?

898
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:47,835
Still, we always need to be careful.

899
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:49,945
Even if you think the fire is out,

900
00:53:49,945 --> 00:53:52,495
piss on it just to make sure it's out.

901
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,285
You just watch out for gigolos.

902
00:53:56,285 --> 00:53:58,945
Gosh, seriously.

903
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,235
- Jand Deuk, get the certificate of registration.
- Yes?

904
00:54:01,235 --> 00:54:02,995
Okay!

905
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:06,745
- What's that?
- What—

906
00:54:06,745 --> 00:54:10,165
Why do you live so high up? Huh?

907
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:11,525
Gosh...

908
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,945
come out.

909
00:54:15,035 --> 00:54:17,185
Let's have a drink.

910
00:54:17,185 --> 00:54:19,175
Who's that punk?

911
00:54:20,975 --> 00:54:22,375
He's my friend.

912
00:54:22,375 --> 00:54:24,975
Gosh, I almost peed myself thinking he was a cop!

913
00:54:24,975 --> 00:54:26,895
- Seriously.
- Aigoo.

914
00:54:26,895 --> 00:54:28,655
Oh, my...

915
00:54:31,455 --> 00:54:33,055
Come on, seriously.

916
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:35,735
Let's really just have one more shot.

917
00:54:35,735 --> 00:54:38,705
Hurry up and go to sleep inside, you punk. Also...

918
00:54:38,705 --> 00:54:42,885
if you come over for a drink one more time, you're dead.

919
00:54:42,885 --> 00:54:44,585
If so...

920
00:54:44,585 --> 00:54:46,855
just kill me now, please.

921
00:54:48,295 --> 00:54:50,885
Who beat you up so bad that your ankle is like that?

922
00:54:50,885 --> 00:54:52,745
Oh, this?

923
00:54:52,745 --> 00:54:54,885
It's from loving my country.

924
00:54:54,885 --> 00:54:56,685
Are you fighting for Independence or something?

925
00:54:56,685 --> 00:54:58,315
We're here.

926
00:54:59,285 --> 00:55:00,945
Choi Cheol Woong.

927
00:55:14,835 --> 00:55:17,905
Whoa, you survived somehow, huh?

928
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:19,765
Shall we have a word separately?

929
00:55:19,765 --> 00:55:21,395
Who the heck are you guys?

930
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:22,825
If you have something to say, say it here.

931
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:24,315
I'm Cheol Woong's sunbae.

932
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:26,695
Don't worry and wait inside.

933
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:28,375
It'll only take a moment.

934
00:55:28,375 --> 00:55:30,985
I told you to talk here.

935
00:55:36,635 --> 00:55:38,555
O-Okay, okay.

936
00:55:38,555 --> 00:55:40,835
Th-These are...

937
00:55:40,835 --> 00:55:43,975
my closest sunbaes.

938
00:55:43,975 --> 00:55:45,505
Hyung...

939
00:55:46,605 --> 00:55:48,905
you go ahead and rest inside.

940
00:55:48,905 --> 00:55:50,155
I'll be right in.

941
00:55:50,155 --> 00:55:52,525
I'm going to leave, you punk.

942
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:55,935
O-Okay.

943
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:00,225
Okay, then. Take care.

944
00:56:26,595 --> 00:56:28,735
Hey, Cheol Woong!

Cheol Woong...

952
00:57:16,655 --> 00:57:18,515
let's be honest here.

953
00:57:18,515 --> 00:57:21,185
How many times do I need to tell you?

954
00:57:21,185 --> 00:57:24,045
I'm really not it.

955
00:57:24,045 --> 00:57:26,515
I'm telling you, I'm not a mole.

956
00:57:26,515 --> 00:57:29,115
Then who's the detective who let you go?

957
00:57:29,115 --> 00:57:31,255
And who's the one who talked to you?

958
00:57:31,255 --> 00:57:32,845
That's why I'm saying...

959
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:37,255
let me talk to the female student who saw it at the dorm.

960
00:57:38,345 --> 00:57:41,365
How is she sure it was me when it was so dark at night?

961
00:57:41,365 --> 00:57:43,105
You were limping, they said!

962
00:57:43,105 --> 00:57:44,205
Who else could it be?

963
00:57:44,205 --> 00:57:45,715
Other friends who were unhurt all got arrested.

964
00:57:45,715 --> 00:57:47,895
But you were the only one who didn't get caught, even with your injury.

965
00:57:47,895 --> 00:57:50,445
- Does this make sense?
- Answer her!

966
00:57:50,445 --> 00:57:51,915
Hyung...

967
00:57:51,915 --> 00:57:55,785
I ran toward the east gate, not the outback.

968
00:57:55,785 --> 00:57:57,935
And I didn't even limp.

969
00:57:57,935 --> 00:58:01,025
I was too nervous and running, so I didn't even know it hurt.

970
00:58:01,025 --> 00:58:05,095
I only realized it hurt after I escaped to safety!

971
00:58:05,095 --> 00:58:08,175
Yes. That's why I drank alcohol!

972
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:11,725
Don't you all have  an experience like that? No?

973
00:58:11,725 --> 00:58:14,595
- Gosh, seriously...
- Cheol Woong...

974
00:58:21,015 --> 00:58:24,265
We all know you didn't want to...

975
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,105
become a spy.

976
00:58:28,105 --> 00:58:30,615
You were drafted by force when you were exempt from service.

977
00:58:30,615 --> 00:58:33,355
And the sudden early discharge.

978
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:39,755
I can guess what those bastards did to you.

979
00:58:39,755 --> 00:58:43,625
Since countless classmates were done like that and even died.

980
00:58:43,625 --> 00:58:47,245
So let it all go and confess now.

981
00:58:47,245 --> 00:58:49,945
We're not trying to harm you right now.

982
00:58:49,945 --> 00:58:52,105
We need to let the world know how evil those bastards

983
00:58:52,105 --> 00:58:56,035
can get in order to trample on democratization!

984
00:58:56,035 --> 00:58:58,325
Cheol Woong, I beg of you.

985
00:58:59,345 --> 00:59:01,515
Let's blow the whistle.

986
00:59:04,085 --> 00:59:05,545
Hyung!

987
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:08,855
♫ <i>Are you going to cower in fear at our enemy's strength?</i> ♫

988
00:59:08,855 --> 00:59:12,565
♫ <i>Are you going to lose hope at our powerlessness?</i> ♫

989
00:59:12,565 --> 00:59:14,535
♫ <i>Where the sword of justice—</i> ♫

990
00:59:14,535 --> 00:59:16,265
You said the talk would only take a little time.

991
00:59:16,265 --> 00:59:18,035
But it must've taken all night.

992
00:59:18,035 --> 00:59:19,335
Where is Cheol Woong?

993
00:59:20,205 --> 00:59:22,815
We had a short talk last night, and I sent him back home.

994
00:59:22,815 --> 00:59:25,085
Gosh, come on now.

995
00:59:25,085 --> 00:59:27,905
I slept alone in Cheol Woong's room until this morning.

996
00:59:27,905 --> 00:59:30,805
Then he must've gone to another drinking buddy.

997
00:59:32,345 --> 00:59:33,965
Hey, wait a minute.

998
00:59:35,035 --> 00:59:38,775
Even educated college students lie, huh?

999
00:59:40,575 --> 00:59:43,135
Cheol Woong's here, isn't he?

1000
00:59:43,135 --> 00:59:44,505
He said he wasn't!

1001
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:46,275
Whoa, you're quite the tough guy.

1002
00:59:46,275 --> 00:59:50,065
Please go back. They're from UDT and the marines.

1003
00:59:50,065 --> 00:59:52,645
Oh, my. How scary.

1004
00:59:52,645 --> 00:59:56,135
I'll count to ten. If Cheol Woong doesn't come out by then,

1005
00:59:56,135 --> 00:59:59,245
I'll be the seeker. Okay?

1006
01:00:04,375 --> 01:00:06,205
Seven...

1007
01:00:06,205 --> 01:00:07,905
Eight...

1008
01:00:11,105 --> 01:00:13,705
Are you all done hiding?

1009
01:00:13,705 --> 01:00:15,885
Nine!

1010
01:00:15,885 --> 01:00:17,415
Ten.

1011
01:00:18,655 --> 01:00:20,885
I'm going to look for him now, okay?

1012
01:00:39,895 --> 01:00:41,905
If you come up here...

1013
01:00:41,905 --> 01:00:43,885
we can't help it, either.

1014
01:00:45,655 --> 01:00:47,365
Shit!

1015
01:01:40,325 --> 01:01:42,555
Hey, it's the cops.

1016
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:47,965
<i>Cheol Woong!</i>

1017
01:01:48,755 --> 01:01:51,295
Choi Cheol Woong, are  you here?

1018
01:01:51,295 --> 01:01:55,085
It's hard for me to find you if you hide too well!

1019
01:02:03,035 --> 01:02:04,675
I wasn't...

1020
01:02:04,675 --> 01:02:07,625
going to go this far on students...

1021
01:02:08,795 --> 01:02:13,915
but the seeker needs to find everyone for it to end. Right?

1022
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:16,005
Okay.

1023
01:02:16,005 --> 01:02:17,955
This little—

1024
01:02:30,635 --> 01:02:32,375
- Get him!
- Stop it!

1025
01:02:35,905 --> 01:02:37,565
Come out.

1026
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,395
I found you.

1027
01:02:47,115 --> 01:02:48,735
Leave.

1028
01:02:56,495 --> 01:02:59,775
Hey, you punk! I almost died.

1029
01:02:59,775 --> 01:03:01,305
Let's go.

1030
01:03:04,495 --> 01:03:06,185
Choi Cheol Woong!

1031
01:03:08,115 --> 01:03:11,455
- Gosh...
- You've got a great friend.

1032
01:03:11,455 --> 01:03:13,335
However...

1033
01:03:13,335 --> 01:03:15,875
let's not live in shame.

1034
01:03:25,505 --> 01:03:26,845
That's right.

1035
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:30,055
We can't live shamefully.

1036
01:03:30,055 --> 01:03:32,625
We can't live embarrassing lives.

1037
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:34,125
But you know...

1038
01:03:34,125 --> 01:03:38,005
even in the worst situation, I did my best not to be shameful.

1039
01:03:40,075 --> 01:03:43,165
If I were really a mole!

1040
01:03:43,165 --> 01:03:46,935
Hyung and all of you, too!

1041
01:03:46,935 --> 01:03:48,505
You guys wouldn't be here right now.

1042
01:03:49,505 --> 01:03:50,965
Get it?

1043
01:03:55,035 --> 01:03:57,875
Hey, let's go. All right?

1044
01:03:57,875 --> 01:03:59,485
Let's go.

1045
01:04:10,405 --> 01:04:12,905
Why didn't you tell them honestly?

1046
01:04:15,035 --> 01:04:17,935
That whistle-blowing thing, you know?

1047
01:04:17,935 --> 01:04:19,415
Right...

1048
01:04:19,415 --> 01:04:23,185
you need to have a whistle to blow it,

1049
01:04:23,185 --> 01:04:25,765
but you don't have a conscience, huh.

1050
01:04:27,385 --> 01:04:28,755
Right?

1051
01:04:30,275 --> 01:04:31,515
By the way,

1052
01:04:31,515 --> 01:04:35,155
why did you come in, even getting beat up like that?

1053
01:04:35,155 --> 01:04:37,255
Were you worried something bad might happen to me?

1054
01:04:37,255 --> 01:04:38,795
Of course.

1055
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:42,885
I don't care about you getting injured or dying,

1056
01:04:42,885 --> 01:04:46,635
but where would I get the payment for the debt you owe me?

1057
01:04:46,635 --> 01:04:48,095
Right?

1058
01:04:48,095 --> 01:04:50,065
You...

1059
01:04:50,065 --> 01:04:53,965
can't die even if you die until you pay me back, you punk.

1060
01:04:55,835 --> 01:04:57,915
I'm in for some deep trouble, huh?

1061
01:04:58,985 --> 01:05:01,135
But at least one thing's resolved.

1062
01:05:01,135 --> 01:05:02,645
You can't...

1063
01:05:02,645 --> 01:05:05,055
do the spying work anymore.

1064
01:05:05,055 --> 01:05:08,905
What would be your use after all this ruckus?

1065
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:14,285
Is that so?

1066
01:05:15,505 --> 01:05:16,935
Oh, my.

1067
01:05:16,935 --> 01:05:20,655
Choi Cheol Woong is one luck guy. How fortunate.

1068
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:23,945
Crazy punk.

1069
01:05:41,965 --> 01:05:43,365
Hyung.

1070
01:05:44,805 --> 01:05:46,225
I...

1071
01:05:47,245 --> 01:05:50,155
really didn't sell out any of my friends

1072
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:53,135
who I did demonstrations with.

1073
01:05:54,515 --> 01:05:56,405
Even when those bastards...

1074
01:05:56,405 --> 01:05:59,685
beat me and threatened me so badly!

1075
01:06:02,685 --> 01:06:03,975
But how...

1076
01:06:05,785 --> 01:06:08,475
How can they do this to me?

1077
01:06:16,195 --> 01:06:17,635
Hey, get on.

1078
01:06:19,115 --> 01:06:21,425
Get on my back, you asshole!

1079
01:06:33,705 --> 01:06:35,025
Aigoo, shit.

1080
01:06:35,935 --> 01:06:37,755
You're so freaking heavy.

1081
01:06:42,105 --> 01:06:43,235
Hyung...

1082
01:06:44,255 --> 01:06:48,135
don't you want to go down to Yeosu once?

1083
01:06:50,515 --> 01:06:54,925
Let's go down, watch a movie, see my dad...

1084
01:06:54,925 --> 01:06:56,965
and see your dad, too.

1085
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:01,375
- And meet Jung Shin, too.
- Cut it out.

1086
01:07:01,375 --> 01:07:02,945
Why?

1087
01:07:02,945 --> 01:07:06,015
You actually want to go, don't you?

1088
01:07:06,015 --> 01:07:07,505
You miss Jung Shin, too, right?

1089
01:07:07,505 --> 01:07:09,645
Gosh, you go there if you want, you punk!

1090
01:07:09,645 --> 01:07:11,215
Hey, this can't do. Get off now.

1091
01:07:11,215 --> 01:07:13,255
- W-Wait.
- Get off!

1092
01:07:13,255 --> 01:07:14,725
Just up to there.

1093
01:07:16,145 --> 01:07:18,985
In that case, shut your trap and

1094
01:07:18,985 --> 01:07:21,345
be quiet on the way, okay?
