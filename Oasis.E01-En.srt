00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:18,088
What if we get caught like this?

168
00:10:19,148 --> 00:10:21,268
What are you guys doing?

169
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,078
Us?

170
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:29,578
Is there anyone else here besides you two?

171
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:31,918
Then what about you?

172
00:10:31,918 --> 00:10:33,888
It's clear what this is...

173
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:37,358
You guys are so naughty, loitering around the backdoor of the theater.

174
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:40,268
What? Gosh, this little kid.

175
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:41,938
Then what are you doing here?

176
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:43,308
This is my house. Why?

177
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:45,118
Yeah, right.

178
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,218
Did this girl eat popped rice* before coming?
(Slang for lying)

179
00:10:47,218 --> 00:10:48,928
Lies keep popping out from her mouth!

180
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:51,578
Piss off before I call someone.

181
00:10:51,578 --> 00:10:52,738
So ridiculous.

182
00:10:52,738 --> 00:10:56,268
We're here confidently, having been invited here.

183
00:10:56,268 --> 00:10:58,748
So, don't bother the oppas,

184
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:00,938
and just go over there and play.

185
00:11:04,298 --> 00:11:06,208
Oh, you're here, Jung Shin?

186
00:11:07,608 --> 00:11:10,058
The lumber?

187
00:11:10,058 --> 00:11:11,618
Ahjussi!

188
00:11:11,618 --> 00:11:13,878
Did you call these guys, Ahjussi?

189
00:11:13,878 --> 00:11:16,858
Oh, well, it's a long story,

190
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:18,188
but if I were to explain concisely,

191
00:11:18,188 --> 00:11:20,918
I have a friend in the lumbermill.

192
00:11:20,918 --> 00:11:23,378
That friend asked me to help these guys watch a movie–

193
00:11:23,378 --> 00:11:24,698
Make them leave right now.

194
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:26,928
If you don't, then I'll tell my dad!

195
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:29,778
This girl is too much!

196
00:11:29,778 --> 00:11:31,208
Then,

197
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:34,478
does your dad know you come in through that backdoor

198
00:11:34,478 --> 00:11:36,508
and watch movies?

199
00:11:37,528 --> 00:11:39,538
- Does he know?
- Hey!

200
00:11:39,538 --> 00:11:41,018
Look at this guy!

201
00:11:41,018 --> 00:11:42,808
Who cares? What does that have to do with you?

202
00:11:42,808 --> 00:11:44,808
- Whoa, whoa.
 - They were the ones who were in the wrong!

203
00:11:44,808 --> 00:11:46,778
Don't be like that.

204
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:56,578
<i>- I might not be able to come for a while.
 - Why?</i>

205
00:11:58,658 --> 00:12:00,738
<i>I feel like something good's going to happen.</i>

206
00:12:00,738 --> 00:12:02,408
<i>What good thing?</i>

207
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,178
I enjoyed the movie, thanks to you.

208
00:12:31,178 --> 00:12:33,578
What are you talking about? It's not like she showed you the movie.

209
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:34,868
If you watched a movie for free at my house,

210
00:12:34,868 --> 00:12:37,678
then basically, I showed it to you.

211
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,608
From now, don't you dare come anywhere near here.

212
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:43,298
- You got that?
 - Don't you come anywhere near here.

213
00:12:43,308 --> 00:12:46,108
That theater is your dad's, not yours.

214
00:12:46,158 --> 00:12:47,548
Is it yours?

215
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,098
What did you say?

216
00:12:49,098 --> 00:12:51,488
These guys who look like freshly dug up potatoes!

217
00:12:51,488 --> 00:12:54,388
- What you say?
 - Potatoes don't like that.

218
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:56,308
Those guys need to die.

219
00:12:56,308 --> 00:12:57,818
- Okay, all right!
- It's going to pop!

220
00:13:00,748 --> 00:13:02,198
Gosh, that thing...

221
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,908
It's so loud.

222
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,738
Wait a sec.

223
00:13:05,738 --> 00:13:07,158
You guys!

224
00:13:07,968 --> 00:13:10,448
Hyung, it's those bastards.

225
00:13:10,448 --> 00:13:12,818
Look at these crazy bastards.

226
00:13:12,818 --> 00:13:14,688
- You got a girl to come with you
- What do we do?

227
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:16,758
- to the movie theater?
- It's them, right?

228
00:13:16,758 --> 00:13:18,718
Hyung, run.

229
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:19,988
Run, run! Quickly!

230
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:21,908
Hurry, hurry!

231
00:13:26,318 --> 00:13:27,868
Hyung, are you all right?

232
00:13:28,718 --> 00:13:31,538
Gosh, this bastard!

- Whoa, whoa...
 - What is it!

247
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,398
A mouse, a mouse...

248
00:14:41,398 --> 00:14:43,068
Damn it...

249
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,928
Just kidding.

250
00:14:54,068 --> 00:14:56,248
- What are you doing!
 - Ow!

251
00:14:56,248 --> 00:14:57,718
I can't even joke?

252
00:15:31,788 --> 00:15:33,498
All right, let's go this way.

253
00:15:43,098 --> 00:15:44,858
Damn it...

254
00:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,418
Well...

255
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:48,928
This is all my father's lumber mill.

256
00:16:48,928 --> 00:16:51,318
Shouldn't we stop by a pharmacy somewhere?

257
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:52,878
Her leg...

258
00:17:05,348 --> 00:17:07,728
If I ever see you guys again,

259
00:17:07,728 --> 00:17:10,318
then I'll really kill you.

260
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:21,691
Accomplish. It means to achieve something.

261
00:17:21,691 --> 00:17:23,841
Adventure. It means an incident,

262
00:17:23,841 --> 00:17:25,901
or an excursion.

263
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:28,051
Adventure...

264
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:32,641
What are you doing?

265
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,171
When did you get here?

266
00:18:35,171 --> 00:18:36,711
I just got here.

267
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:38,961
But what were you doing?

268
00:18:38,961 --> 00:18:41,211
Oh, it's nothing.

269
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:43,441
I was studying vocabulary.

270
00:18:46,261 --> 00:18:49,011
Why are you being like this? I told you I was studying vocabulary!

271
00:18:49,011 --> 00:18:51,851
To the girl whose name I don't know.

272
00:18:55,401 --> 00:18:59,361
Gosh, is this studying English vocabulary?

273
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:03,951
My name is Lee Doo Hak.

274
00:19:04,941 --> 00:19:09,231
I felt so sorry about and bothered by what happened at the theater,

275
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,501
so after some thought–

276
00:19:13,471 --> 00:19:16,961
Is this a love letter you're writing to that girl?

277
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,511
How is that a love letter?

278
00:19:19,511 --> 00:19:21,631
Since she scraped her knee that day,

279
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:23,401
I felt bothered and sorry, so I just wrote it.

280
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:26,011
I wasn't even thinking of sending it.

281
00:19:29,201 --> 00:19:30,541
Then,

282
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:33,741
why is your face so red?

283
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:34,931
What?

284
00:19:34,931 --> 00:19:36,261
Well...

285
00:19:36,261 --> 00:19:38,981
it's because the sun is hot!

286
00:19:38,981 --> 00:19:41,561
Come on, I know you, Hyung.

287
00:19:41,561 --> 00:19:43,211
Let's become honest with each other.

288
00:19:43,211 --> 00:19:45,181
You probably feel the same way as me.

289
00:19:46,081 --> 00:19:49,171
That girl's face keeps appearing before your eyes,

290
00:19:49,171 --> 00:19:54,511
and you can hear your heart like a drum in your ears, right?

291
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:56,321
Hyung.

292
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,401
Will you be able to beat me?

293
00:19:58,401 --> 00:20:00,481
Who said I would fight with you?

294
00:20:00,481 --> 00:20:03,021
I really don't care, so you do what you want!

295
00:20:03,021 --> 00:20:06,321
Gosh, don't play dirty with me.

296
00:20:06,321 --> 00:20:09,071
If you like her, then you should fight with me for her, fair and square!

297
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:10,551
Also,

298
00:20:10,551 --> 00:20:13,051
the most important thing is

299
00:20:13,051 --> 00:20:17,041
her feelings rather than ours, no?

300
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:25,471
She is not a girl whose name you don't know.

301
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:27,191
Oh Jung Shin.

302
00:20:27,191 --> 00:20:29,601
A second-year student at Yeosu High School for Girls.

303
00:20:29,601 --> 00:20:31,751
She transferred there early this year.

304
00:20:31,751 --> 00:20:33,731
Her father ran a theater in Seoul,

305
00:20:33,731 --> 00:20:36,171
but he came down here to recuperate because he wasn't feeling well,

306
00:20:36,171 --> 00:20:38,111
and she came with him.

307
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,071
But,

308
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:44,541
do you know what the craziest piece of info is?

309
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:50,591
- It's not our first time meeting her.
 - What?

310
00:20:50,591 --> 00:20:52,021
What,

311
00:20:52,021 --> 00:20:54,681
you know the the brass band leader

312
00:20:54,681 --> 00:20:57,121
from Jinnam Festival, right?

313
00:20:57,121 --> 00:20:59,211
The girl who was twirling the baton!

314
00:20:59,211 --> 00:21:01,181
That's her.

315
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:07,351
Are you serious?

316
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:10,251
If I want to start, I should have at least this much information.

317
00:21:10,251 --> 00:21:12,141
Don't you think so?

Be careful...

331
00:21:59,411 --> 00:22:00,971
Aigoo, aigoo, aigoo...

332
00:22:00,971 --> 00:22:02,781
Aigoo...

333
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:05,471
Your husband is a bit drunk...

334
00:22:05,471 --> 00:22:07,431
Hey, Cheol Woong.

335
00:22:07,431 --> 00:22:08,681
Yes, Father.

336
00:22:09,811 --> 00:22:11,801
You need to

337
00:22:11,801 --> 00:22:14,361
live like your grandfather.

338
00:22:14,361 --> 00:22:16,051
You got that?

339
00:22:17,781 --> 00:22:20,461
- Yes.
 - No matter what anyone says,

340
00:22:20,461 --> 00:22:22,291
white is white,

341
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,901
and black is black.

342
00:22:23,901 --> 00:22:25,521
Why are you saying that to our child?

343
00:22:25,521 --> 00:22:26,981
Please wash up quickly and go to bed.

344
00:22:26,981 --> 00:22:29,661
- Okay, okay.
 - Aigoo, Hyungnim.

345
00:22:29,661 --> 00:22:33,011
Aigoo, I'm sorry that I'm always just causing you trouble.

346
00:22:33,011 --> 00:22:35,301
Then have a safe trip home.

347
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:38,021
Gosh, Mr. Choi is doing it again.

348
00:22:38,021 --> 00:22:39,641
Hurry inside and get some rest.

349
00:22:39,641 --> 00:22:41,891
Okay, be on your way. I'll...

350
00:22:42,881 --> 00:22:44,311
Oh.

351
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:47,691
Good night.

352
00:22:55,411 --> 00:22:58,971
Ahjussi, thank you for all your hard work,

353
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:00,521
Gosh,

354
00:23:00,521 --> 00:23:05,341
it appears that your father is upset about a lot of things.

355
00:23:05,341 --> 00:23:07,691
You should understand him, okay?

356
00:23:07,691 --> 00:23:09,201
Okay.

357
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,691
When I look at you, Cheol Woong,

358
00:23:13,691 --> 00:23:17,321
you take after your grandfather.

359
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:21,721
You will become a great person

360
00:23:21,721 --> 00:23:24,461
just like your grandfather.

361
00:23:24,461 --> 00:23:25,891
Well...

362
00:23:25,891 --> 00:23:28,581
If I could be like him in the slightest, I would be happy.

363
00:23:28,581 --> 00:23:31,671
Aigoo, how you're also humble...

364
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:35,171
You are truly an adult.

365
00:23:39,181 --> 00:23:47,271
♫ <i>I will go. I will leave.</i> ♫

366
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:53,841
♫ <i>Holding my young son's hand.</i> ♫

367
00:23:55,141 --> 00:24:00,231
♫ <i>To where we plant potatoes...</i> ♫

368
00:24:00,231 --> 00:24:02,021
Doo Hak.

369
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:06,611
Your father is in such a great mood today.

370
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:07,791
Why, Father?

371
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:12,701
While I was in town with Mr. Choi, I met your teacher,

372
00:24:12,701 --> 00:24:15,101
and he said you entered high school

373
00:24:15,101 --> 00:24:17,931
in first place.

374
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:21,011
I heard that you also swore the oath as the representative of the entering students.

375
00:24:21,011 --> 00:24:23,661
How come you didn't say anything?

376
00:24:23,661 --> 00:24:25,681
Oh, that...

377
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:28,901
I thought they would tell you to come in and pay for a party.

378
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:32,071
Even though I am poor and can't afford a cow,

379
00:24:32,071 --> 00:24:35,431
I would have slaughtered a pig for you if you had told me.

380
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:37,141
In any case,

381
00:24:37,141 --> 00:24:41,171
he complimented me for raising you well

382
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:44,961
because you're smart and polite.

383
00:24:44,961 --> 00:24:46,821
So I had a nice drink

384
00:24:46,821 --> 00:24:50,961
of unrefined rice wine with your teacher.

385
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:00,281
But,

386
00:25:01,481 --> 00:25:04,021
don't do that in the future.

387
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,381
Excuse me?

388
00:25:06,381 --> 00:25:09,421
What good will come from you beating Cheol Woong?

389
00:25:09,421 --> 00:25:13,121
Cheol Woong supposedly cried a lot because he wasn't in first.

390
00:25:13,121 --> 00:25:17,021
It was only then that Mr. Choi told me laughing.

391
00:25:17,021 --> 00:25:19,081
Doo Hak.

392
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,651
Haven't I told you many times before?

393
00:25:21,651 --> 00:25:24,621
A person should know what's right.

394
00:25:24,621 --> 00:25:27,711
No matter how smart and talented you are,

395
00:25:27,711 --> 00:25:31,621
if you don't know what's right, you're no different from a cow or a pig.

396
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,401
Whose field is this?

397
00:25:33,401 --> 00:25:35,581
Who have I to thank for learning to read

398
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,881
and being able to feed and clothe our family?

399
00:25:37,881 --> 00:25:40,541
That is all thanks to Cheol Woong's grandfather.

400
00:25:40,541 --> 00:25:45,601
If you know that, you would be loathe to even step on the shadow of their house.

401
00:25:45,601 --> 00:25:47,771
So...

402
00:25:50,151 --> 00:25:52,561
don't get first place.

403
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:55,061
I'm telling you to not beat him...

404
00:25:55,061 --> 00:25:57,401
in whatever it is that Cheol Woong does.

405
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,601
You understand

406
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:02,721
what I'm saying?

407
00:26:05,481 --> 00:26:07,891
I understand what you're saying, Father,

408
00:26:07,891 --> 00:26:09,331
but...

409
00:26:10,411 --> 00:26:12,311
until when?

410
00:26:17,441 --> 00:26:19,141
Forever.

411
00:26:23,981 --> 00:26:26,271
You can promise me, right?

412
00:26:28,701 --> 00:26:30,331
Yes, Father.

413
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:40,941
I saw this morning that your toe was sticking out of your shoe.

414
00:26:40,941 --> 00:26:44,331
I don't know why that woman brought back such tattered shoes for you.

415
00:27:10,141 --> 00:27:12,361
Can you see anything?

416
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:13,821
Not yet.

417
00:27:13,821 --> 00:27:16,771
Damn it. Maybe she's not practicing today.

418
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:19,351
Gosh, I'm sure I heard they were practicing

419
00:27:19,351 --> 00:27:22,101
for the Alumni Field Day.

420
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:23,321
She will come out.

421
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:25,331
Hey, how about you come down for now?
 - Wait, wait!

422
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:27,251
She's coming out!

423
00:27:27,251 --> 00:27:28,811
Whoa, whoa!

424
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,961
Did you find her?

425
00:27:36,961 --> 00:27:39,091
I don't see her yet.

426
00:27:45,191 --> 00:27:47,011
Did she come out?

427
00:27:47,011 --> 00:27:49,491
I asked you if she came out!

428
00:27:49,491 --> 00:27:51,091
Gosh, seriously!

429
00:28:04,631 --> 00:28:06,191
Gosh!

430
00:28:34,521 --> 00:28:35,891
Hi.

431
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,631
Hey, come on.

432
00:28:40,871 --> 00:28:43,091
How are you?

433
00:28:43,091 --> 00:28:45,131
You guy must be playing me right now.

434
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:48,561
I told you that the if I ever see you guys again–
 - You will kill us.

435
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,651
Right.

436
00:29:00,081 --> 00:29:01,821
Bruce Lee?

437
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,511
You know that too!

438
00:29:07,971 --> 00:29:11,711
I've rewatched The Big Boss, Fist of Fury, The Way of the Dragon, and Enter the Dragon so many times,

439
00:29:11,711 --> 00:29:13,541
that I'm pretty good at twirling this.

440
00:29:26,271 --> 00:29:29,311
All right. Who wants to die first?

441
00:29:30,551 --> 00:29:31,901
Well,

442
00:29:31,901 --> 00:29:34,651
before we die, we have a wish.

443
00:29:34,651 --> 00:29:36,411
H-Hey...

444
00:29:36,411 --> 00:29:39,111
How about you die before your wish?

445
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:54,341
Wow, did you want to die so badly that your brains got fried?

446
00:29:54,341 --> 00:29:56,811
After all that you put me through, you want...

447
00:29:56,811 --> 00:29:58,811
you want to date me?

448
00:29:59,911 --> 00:30:02,571
These guys! I should just–

449
00:30:07,981 --> 00:30:09,111
Please make your choice right here.

450
00:30:09,111 --> 00:30:12,481
Otherwise, you will have to kill us to leave.

451
00:30:12,481 --> 00:30:13,421
Yeah.

452
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:16,251
You guys are quite determined.

453
00:30:16,251 --> 00:30:17,691
You.

454
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:19,141
You're not afraid of me?

455
00:30:19,141 --> 00:30:21,401
I am. But...

456
00:30:21,401 --> 00:30:24,281
you're pretty.

457
00:30:34,721 --> 00:30:36,141
Don't laugh.

458
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:38,271
I've put my life on the line for this!

459
00:30:38,271 --> 00:30:39,691
All right.

460
00:30:40,721 --> 00:30:44,901
Hyung. Isn't it a bit too much to say you put your life on the line?

461
00:30:44,901 --> 00:30:46,171
Is it?

462
00:30:46,171 --> 00:30:47,941
What about you?

463
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:49,921
What did you put on the line?

464
00:30:49,921 --> 00:30:51,481
Me?

465
00:30:52,811 --> 00:30:56,011
Oh, you think I wouldn't put my life on the line?

466
00:30:56,011 --> 00:30:57,641
Well...

467
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,481
obviously, my life is on the line,

468
00:31:01,481 --> 00:31:04,261
and if you don't go out with me, I will run around the neighborhood

469
00:31:04,261 --> 00:31:06,471
yelling your name, Oh Jung Shin!

470
00:31:06,471 --> 00:31:08,771
Put on your clothes! Put it on, put it on!

471
00:31:08,771 --> 00:31:10,511
Okay, okay.

472
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:17,211
Gosh. These guys are nutjobs!

473
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:21,631
You guys are the first I've seen put their lives on the line.

474
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:24,061
Okay. But let's say that

475
00:31:24,061 --> 00:31:27,231
I go out with one of you.

476
00:31:27,231 --> 00:31:33,781
Who should I choose, yo–

477
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:36,221
gurt.

478
00:31:37,171 --> 00:31:39,151
<i>I'm telling you to not beat him...</i>

479
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:41,951
<i>in whatever it is that Cheol Woong does.</i>

480
00:31:45,181 --> 00:31:46,651
You two.

481
00:31:47,671 --> 00:31:49,371
What relationship do you guys have?

482
00:31:50,341 --> 00:31:53,201
- Well... w-we're friends.
 - He's my hyung.

483
00:31:54,111 --> 00:31:55,881
What?

484
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:58,471
Oh.

485
00:31:59,431 --> 00:32:01,601
He's a hyung who's like a real hyung to me,

486
00:32:01,601 --> 00:32:03,081
but he was left back a year.

487
00:32:03,081 --> 00:32:06,021
His family and my family are really close.

488
00:32:06,021 --> 00:32:09,121
- Hyung's family is–
 - Gosh, maybe it's because I ate so fast,

489
00:32:09,121 --> 00:32:10,231
but my stomach hurts.

490
00:32:10,231 --> 00:32:13,681
Cheol Woong, I'm going to go so come back after you finish up your conversation.

491
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:15,451
Sit down.

492
00:32:16,481 --> 00:32:19,221
- I told you that my stomach hurts...
 - Don't run away,

493
00:32:20,221 --> 00:32:21,861
and sit down.

494
00:32:22,761 --> 00:32:24,281
Sit down.

They say that you should grant the wishes of dead people.

497
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,801
Then... are you going to date us?

498
00:32:35,561 --> 00:32:37,251
Oh my... wait!

500
00:32:38,641 --> 00:32:40,641
I'll meet with you.

501
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:45,181
But, with whom?

502
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,111
I don't know. Let's wait and see for that one.

503
00:32:47,111 --> 00:32:48,881
How can I pick when I've only seen you a couple times?

504
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:52,001
How long are you going to wait and see?

505
00:32:54,021 --> 00:32:55,811
For about a year?

506
00:32:55,811 --> 00:32:58,761
Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?

507
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:01,491
Can't you choose a bit more quickly?

508
00:33:01,491 --> 00:33:02,991
One year is a bit...

509
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,031
What do you think about it, Hyung?

510
00:33:05,031 --> 00:33:06,851
I'm fine even if it's late.

511
00:33:07,841 --> 00:33:10,561
I'm fine with it even if it takes even longer.

512
00:33:10,561 --> 00:33:14,101
Or even if it gets delayed forever.

513
00:33:14,101 --> 00:33:15,491
Gosh...

514
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:17,541
You'll grow old and die waiting like that.

591

I said I just got lucky!

592

Gosh, no.

631
00:40:16,451 --> 00:40:18,221
Jung Shin studied really hard.

632
00:40:18,221 --> 00:40:19,681
That's right. I studied hard.

639
00:40:48,591 --> 00:40:51,011
I was so surprised to hear from you.

640
00:40:51,011 --> 00:40:54,851
I did think I might get to see you

641
00:40:54,851 --> 00:40:56,751
once at some point.

642
00:40:56,751 --> 00:40:58,521
When I heard that

643
00:40:58,521 --> 00:41:01,241
you came to Yeosu,

644
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,351
I was a bit surprised.

645
00:41:03,351 --> 00:41:05,221

651
00:41:26,681 --> 00:41:28,521
Yes.

652
00:41:28,521 --> 00:41:30,731
Good thing you didn't marry me.

653
00:41:30,731 --> 00:41:32,221
If you had married me,

654
00:41:32,221 --> 00:41:34,701
you would've had to follow me to all different military bases

655
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,861
and you'd already be a country folk ahjumma.

656
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:39,451
I'm sorry.

00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:41,661
Only if it weren't for my father's opposition...

658
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,121
Oh, no.

659
00:41:43,121 --> 00:41:45,681
He was able to see into the future.

660
00:41:46,721 --> 00:41:48,491
I hope he's healthy?

661
00:41:49,721 --> 00:41:51,451
He passed away.

662
00:41:51,451 --> 00:41:54,851
He had a stroke after he dropped out of the campaign.

663
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,701
I see.

664
00:41:56,701 --> 00:41:58,181
I'm sorry to hear that.

665
00:41:58,181 --> 00:42:00,081
It's okay.

666
00:42:00,081 --> 00:42:02,161
But what is this about?

667
00:42:02,161 --> 00:42:04,401
I'm sure you didn't want to meet me to just greet.

668
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,711
Actually,

669
00:42:10,711 --> 00:42:12,991
I have a favor to ask of you, Oppa.

670
00:42:12,991 --> 00:42:15,561
You like Chinese food, I see.

671
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:18,251
Come over some time.

672
00:42:18,251 --> 00:42:20,341
I'll buy you some again.

673
00:42:20,341 --> 00:42:22,821
Yes. I'll come over often.

674
00:42:22,821 --> 00:42:25,861
I heard your father runs a lumbermill.

675
00:42:25,861 --> 00:42:28,541
Your family is quite famous in Yeosu.

676
00:42:28,541 --> 00:42:29,781
Yes.

677
00:42:29,781 --> 00:42:33,501
It must be because my grandfather Choi Byung Cheol had been involved in the Korean Independence Movement.

678
00:42:33,501 --> 00:42:35,211
I heard.

679
00:42:35,211 --> 00:42:37,341
He was a great man.

680
00:42:39,051 --> 00:42:43,011
So, what does your father do for a living?

681
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,501
Yes, well...

682
00:42:46,341 --> 00:42:48,251
He's just a farmer.

683
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:53,421
It must be tough for him.

684
00:42:53,421 --> 00:42:56,281
But since he has a scholastic son like you,

685
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:58,101
he must be so proud.

686
00:42:58,101 --> 00:42:59,861
Yes.

687
00:42:59,861 --> 00:43:02,731
As they say, "A dragon rises from a small stream.*"
(A phrase about rising from a humble beginning)

688
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:11,851
Of course.

689
00:43:11,851 --> 00:43:13,551
Doo Hak's father

690
00:43:13,551 --> 00:43:17,121
used to be my family servant.

691
00:43:17,121 --> 00:43:21,431
But my grandfather sent him to elementary school and got him to study.

692
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:23,741
And as he left for Manchuria for the Independence Movement,

693
00:43:23,741 --> 00:43:27,831
I heard he burned his slave contract.

694
00:43:29,131 --> 00:43:31,371
Choi Cheol Woong, you're really...

695
00:43:31,371 --> 00:43:32,651
Huh?

696
00:43:33,871 --> 00:43:35,921
What I'm saying is...

697
00:43:35,921 --> 00:43:38,171
Since you said a dragon rises from a small stream...

698
00:43:38,171 --> 00:43:43,371
I'm just saying Doo Hak hyung comes from a difficult family...

699
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,461
Well...

700
00:43:46,461 --> 00:43:50,081
I don't know about a dragon rising from a stream.

701
00:43:50,081 --> 00:43:53,231
The fact that my family received a lot of help Cheol Woong's grandfather...

702
00:43:53,231 --> 00:43:55,691
My father and I also know...

703
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:00,561
that it's a great favor he had shown us which won't forget until the day we die.

704
00:44:02,561 --> 00:44:03,881
That's right.

705
00:44:03,881 --> 00:44:06,621
You're very thoughtful.

706
00:44:18,851 --> 00:44:20,491
Do you mean that?

707
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:23,111
Yes. I mean it.

708
00:44:24,691 --> 00:44:27,481
His views are completely opposite from our party.

709
00:44:27,481 --> 00:44:28,851
As well as his late father.

710
00:44:28,851 --> 00:44:32,751
Isn't that how the image of Gukhan Party would improve?

711
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:34,421
Someone from a family who led the Korean Independence Movement

712
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:38,691
and with opposing political views has also joined Gukhan Party.

713
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:42,581
It's also effective in cutting off the funding support to the opposition party from the southwestern region.

714
00:44:45,761 --> 00:44:48,001
I just assumed.

715
00:44:48,001 --> 00:44:51,161
But if you make such a face, I get so embarrassed.

716
00:45:04,321 --> 00:45:06,311
I ask of you, Oppa.

717
00:45:09,111 --> 00:45:11,811
Is this what we've become now?

718
00:45:16,071 --> 00:45:17,761
But...

719
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:19,431
did you get your husband to agree?

720
00:45:19,431 --> 00:45:20,651
Of course.

721
00:45:21,601 --> 00:45:23,831
If I help your husband,

722
00:45:23,831 --> 00:45:26,041
what do I get in return?

723
00:45:44,431 --> 00:45:46,131
Are you okay?

724
00:45:52,221 --> 00:45:53,651
Doo Hak.

725
00:45:54,841 --> 00:45:56,351
Wipe with this.

726
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,021
And let's go to a pharmacy.

727
00:45:59,941 --> 00:46:01,471
I'm okay.

728
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,331
Go home.

729
00:46:03,331 --> 00:46:05,211
You're not okay.

730
00:46:05,211 --> 00:46:07,391
I said to go home.

731
00:46:08,631 --> 00:46:09,881
Doo Hak...

732
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:12,661
I don't want to see you! So go home!

733
00:46:16,711 --> 00:46:17,811
Hyung...

734
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:20,481
I'm...

735
00:46:20,481 --> 00:46:22,301
sorry.

736
00:46:26,351 --> 00:46:27,971
And you call yourself a friend?

737
00:46:27,971 --> 00:46:30,891
Are you the only one with self-respect? And Doo Hak has none?

738
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:32,991
What a petty bastard.

739
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:48,391
Geez, that girl. She's got quite a stinging slap.

740
00:46:52,651 --> 00:46:55,071
Are you all right?

741
00:46:55,071 --> 00:46:57,211
I'm really sorry.

742
00:46:57,211 --> 00:47:00,451
I didn't mean to say it like that.

743
00:47:01,711 --> 00:47:02,951
Hyung!

744
00:47:03,961 --> 00:47:06,051
I said I'm sorry.

745
00:47:06,051 --> 00:47:07,881
Please let it go just once.

746
00:47:10,401 --> 00:47:12,071
I deserve to die.

747
00:47:12,071 --> 00:47:15,581
I wanted to rip my mouth open, too.

748
00:47:20,601 --> 00:47:22,591
Let's not do this...

749
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:26,431
and just beat me up until you feel better.

750
00:47:30,341 --> 00:47:32,781
Cheol Woong, you asshole!

751
00:47:32,781 --> 00:47:34,781
You bastard! Disloyal traitor!

752
00:47:34,781 --> 00:47:37,191
Worse than a dog!

753
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,421
Hit me!

754
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:45,871
I deserve to get beaten!

755
00:47:45,871 --> 00:47:47,321
Stop it.

756
00:47:47,321 --> 00:47:48,591
It's fine.

757
00:47:48,591 --> 00:47:50,471
What's fine?

758
00:47:50,471 --> 00:47:52,301
I want to get beaten more.

759
00:47:53,851 --> 00:47:56,411
I get how you feel.

760
00:47:56,411 --> 00:47:58,081
So, stop it.

761
00:48:02,501 --> 00:48:04,381
Do you really...

762
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,771
know how I feel?

763
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:07,331
Yeah.

764
00:48:11,781 --> 00:48:13,341
Damn it!

765
00:48:26,951 --> 00:48:29,741
Aigoo, my back...

766
00:48:38,971 --> 00:48:43,871
Whoa! It tastes like honey, not water!

767
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:47,961
Even though you came out of my womb,

768
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:50,201
it's so amazing whenever I see you.

769
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:51,561
What do you mean?

770
00:48:51,561 --> 00:48:54,091
Your father barely learned to read

771
00:48:54,091 --> 00:48:57,331
and I might as well be blind with my eyes wide open.

772
00:48:57,331 --> 00:49:01,491
Makes me wonder how I managed to give birth to someone like you.

773
00:49:01,491 --> 00:49:03,521
And you even help out with farming.

774
00:49:03,521 --> 00:49:06,521
I'm saying how do you study on top of that?

775
00:49:06,521 --> 00:49:09,491
Where you plant beans, you harvest beans. Not red beans.

776
00:49:09,491 --> 00:49:11,841
If your father gave you schooling,

777
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,101
I'm sure you would've become a judge or a prosecutor, Mom.

778
00:49:14,101 --> 00:49:15,741
Right on.

779
00:49:15,741 --> 00:49:19,691
If that had happened, I would've never met such a stuffy man like your father

780
00:49:19,691 --> 00:49:22,541
and met a stylish man in Seoul.

781
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:24,031
Isn't that right?

782
00:49:25,001 --> 00:49:26,231
Right!

783
00:49:29,601 --> 00:49:31,161
Doo Hak.

784
00:49:31,161 --> 00:49:34,251
Do you when I feel the most satisfied?

785
00:49:35,241 --> 00:49:38,241
When I awake from a light sleep

786
00:49:38,241 --> 00:49:44,121
and see your back while studying at your desk. I feel most satisfied then!

787
00:49:44,121 --> 00:49:48,261
Makes me think, "That guy's bound to become something great!"

788
00:49:49,981 --> 00:49:52,631
Aren't you envious of Cheol Woong?

789
00:49:54,141 --> 00:49:55,231
No.

790
00:49:55,231 --> 00:49:56,571
Don't you worry.

791
00:49:56,571 --> 00:49:59,501
I've saved up tons already.

792
00:49:59,501 --> 00:50:03,301
You'll be able to live rich and proud down the road.

793
00:50:03,301 --> 00:50:04,681
Save up for what?

794
00:50:04,681 --> 00:50:07,051
I know you have no money.

795
00:50:07,051 --> 00:50:09,461
Money isn't the only thing you save up.

796
00:50:09,461 --> 00:50:13,271
At times, you also save and cherish people.

797
00:50:13,271 --> 00:50:15,171
What do you mean by that?

798
00:50:16,771 --> 00:50:19,641
There's something like that.

799
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:22,391
So, go back in and either go to the library or study at home.

800
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:23,861
Just go and study, got it?

801
00:50:23,861 --> 00:50:25,721
I'll do the rest by myself.

802
00:50:25,721 --> 00:50:27,981
- But I'm okay!
- Hurry up and go in!

803
00:50:27,981 --> 00:50:30,991
Come on! Hurry, hurry, hurry!

804
00:51:10,511 --> 00:51:12,751
Come and sit down for a minute.

805
00:51:19,771 --> 00:51:21,551
You know, I think...

806
00:51:22,591 --> 00:51:26,801
you've learned enough at this rate.

807
00:51:26,801 --> 00:51:29,701
Why don't you just farm with me?

808
00:51:29,701 --> 00:51:30,971
Pardon?

809
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:33,881
As for Jung Ok, she'd belong to another family once she's married off.

810
00:51:33,881 --> 00:51:36,081
You're the only son I've got.

811
00:51:36,081 --> 00:51:38,221
What's going to happened to all this farm work?

812
00:51:38,221 --> 00:51:39,561
And...

813
00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,641
I just don't have the confidence to support you through college

814
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:46,201
by farming this small plot of land.

815
00:51:46,201 --> 00:51:48,061
- So...
- Father.

816
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:50,461
You're saying this because of Cheol Woong, aren't you/

817
00:51:50,461 --> 00:51:53,191
It's because I beat Cheol Woong, right?

818
00:51:53,191 --> 00:51:55,161
Why? Did Cheol Woong cry again?

819
00:51:55,161 --> 00:51:58,771
Father, why can't I study?

820
00:51:58,771 --> 00:52:01,551
Why can't I be number one in class?

821
00:52:01,551 --> 00:52:05,721
Other parents praise their kids when they rank number one!

822
00:52:05,721 --> 00:52:09,871
Why do you try to stop me from studying and ranking on top?

823
00:52:11,471 --> 00:52:13,181
Father,

824
00:52:13,181 --> 00:52:15,461
if we received favor from Cheol Woong's grandfather,

825
00:52:15,461 --> 00:52:18,271
we can repay them when I become successful later on.

826
00:52:18,271 --> 00:52:22,221
We don't live in the feudal age or in Joseon dynasty!

827
00:52:22,221 --> 00:52:25,091
Why do I have to live like a servant, too!

828
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:26,631
You punk!

829
00:52:26,631 --> 00:52:29,781
Are you trying to lecture your father?

830
00:52:29,781 --> 00:52:32,621
If you become more learned, you'll try to swallow me up!

831
00:52:32,621 --> 00:52:35,571
That's why I'm telling you to stop studying!

832
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:41,641
Father...

833
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:43,141
Father!

834
00:52:44,571 --> 00:52:46,311
I'll never say that again.

835
00:52:46,311 --> 00:52:49,021
I must've lost my mind for a minute there.

836
00:52:49,931 --> 00:52:51,521
Father...

837
00:52:51,521 --> 00:52:54,101
I'll make sure I'll never become a nuisance to

838
00:52:54,101 --> 00:52:55,891
Mr. Choi's family and to Cheol Woong.

839
00:52:55,891 --> 00:52:58,221
I swear it! Please!

840
00:52:59,461 --> 00:53:01,221
Father...

841
00:53:02,361 --> 00:53:03,921
I really...

842
00:53:03,921 --> 00:53:06,231
I really want to study.

843
00:53:06,231 --> 00:53:08,871
I don't even hope for college.

844
00:53:08,871 --> 00:53:11,251
Please let me finish high school. Then...

845
00:53:11,251 --> 00:53:15,091
I'll do as you say, Father.

846
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,981
And...

847
00:53:16,981 --> 00:53:18,941
I will...

848
00:53:18,941 --> 00:53:20,491
never...

849
00:53:21,421 --> 00:53:25,581
I'll never upset Cheol Woong.

850
00:53:25,581 --> 00:53:27,361
Father, please...

851
00:53:27,361 --> 00:53:29,111
Please...

852
00:53:31,201 --> 00:53:32,671
Then,

853
00:53:33,801 --> 00:53:35,581
tranfer out of your school.

854
00:54:09,641 --> 00:54:10,911
Aigoo!

855
00:54:10,911 --> 00:54:12,781
What brings you here at this hour, Honey?

856
00:54:12,781 --> 00:54:14,201
Honey.

857
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:15,511
I did it.

858
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:18,541
It's all done now.

859
00:54:18,541 --> 00:54:20,661
What are you talking about?

860
00:54:20,661 --> 00:54:23,091
You'll become an assemblyman now.

861
00:54:23,091 --> 00:54:24,261
What?

862
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,101
You'll be nominated!

863
00:54:29,081 --> 00:54:31,701
Wait, come see me, Honey.

864
00:54:37,071 --> 00:54:39,931
What are you talking about? What nomination?

865
00:54:39,931 --> 00:54:42,441
By chance, have you been in contact with Minyoung Party?

866
00:54:42,441 --> 00:54:46,651
If you're bound to do it, you might as well hold on to a strong and thick rope of support.

867
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:47,921
What? Then...

868
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:49,921
By chance, Gukhan Party?

869
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,961
Are you out of your mind!

870
00:54:52,961 --> 00:54:54,541
You've been nominated.

871
00:54:54,541 --> 00:54:57,421
Why are you getting so angry when you've pretty much won the assemblyman seat?

872
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:00,601
Come on. Listen to you. I had my doubts about what you were saying.

873
00:55:00,601 --> 00:55:02,221
What? Gukhan Party?

874
00:55:02,221 --> 00:55:05,481
Are you telling me to become a dog to a dictator right now?

875
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:08,351
I'm not saying you should become their dog.

876
00:55:08,351 --> 00:55:11,921
Don't you know that you need to walk into a lion's den if you want to catch a lion?

877
00:55:11,921 --> 00:55:14,841
If a critical figure joins the party and says what needs to be said,

878
00:55:14,841 --> 00:55:17,071
how nice would that be?

879
00:55:17,071 --> 00:55:20,221
No matter how much you try to get through to them from the outside, it's no use.

880
00:55:20,221 --> 00:55:23,131
Also, they're saying they'll be generous and accept you.

881
00:55:23,131 --> 00:55:25,481
Why would you refuse that?

882
00:55:25,481 --> 00:55:27,631
I just can't get through to you.

883
00:55:27,631 --> 00:55:28,981
Yeah, right.

884
00:55:28,981 --> 00:55:31,771
Why don't you do all those great things, then?

885
00:55:31,771 --> 00:55:36,451
Honey. This was so difficult to accomplish.

886
00:55:36,451 --> 00:55:39,331
It's a chance we can raise up our family again.

887
00:55:40,671 --> 00:55:43,831
You mean raise your side of the family.

888
00:55:43,831 --> 00:55:46,711
Our family has never faltered.

889
00:55:46,711 --> 00:55:47,821
Honey...

890
00:55:47,821 --> 00:55:52,211
I mean, how could you not know me at all after living with me for 20 years?

891
00:55:53,441 --> 00:55:55,111
That's right!

892
00:55:55,111 --> 00:55:57,381
All the money you worked so hard to make, you gave them away to all kinds of people

893
00:55:57,381 --> 00:56:00,371
and made some nobody an assemblymen!

894
00:56:00,371 --> 00:56:01,891
You worry about the country so much!

895
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,161
Can't you get into politics yourself?

896
00:56:04,161 --> 00:56:05,861
Instead of rotting away in this countryside

897
00:56:05,861 --> 00:56:08,851
drinking rice wine with farmers!

898
00:56:11,801 --> 00:56:13,461
This is my hometown.

899
00:56:13,461 --> 00:56:15,191
This countryside you speak of!

900
00:56:15,191 --> 00:56:18,621
I have lived as your wife

901
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:21,571
and this family's daughter-in-law for 20 years.

902
00:56:21,571 --> 00:56:25,301
I had no idea what a fool you were.

903
00:56:25,301 --> 00:56:28,261
Do you know how much running around I did for you?

904
00:56:28,261 --> 00:56:30,121
Do you even know what I went through!

905
00:56:30,971 --> 00:56:33,681
Yet not even a word of thank you...

906
00:56:39,141 --> 00:56:41,181
Pardon?

907
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,431
My goodness...

908
00:56:43,431 --> 00:56:45,731
So, something like that had happened, huh...

909
00:56:45,731 --> 00:56:48,691
He insists on throwing away a nice table that's all set up for him.

910
00:56:48,691 --> 00:56:51,631
I feel like I'm going to die from a breakdown.

911
00:56:51,631 --> 00:56:53,431
So that's why I'm saying this to you.

912
00:56:53,431 --> 00:56:55,271
I think he might...

913
00:56:55,271 --> 00:56:57,311
listen to you, Ahjussi.

914
00:56:58,291 --> 00:56:59,581
Pardon?

915
00:57:00,731 --> 00:57:02,831
Aigoo, I'm just a mere farming hand.

916
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:05,751
I know nothing more than farming.

917
00:57:05,751 --> 00:57:07,231
Besides...

918
00:57:07,231 --> 00:57:09,701
once Mr. Choi makes up his mind,

919
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,701
he is so stubborn as hell.

920
00:57:11,701 --> 00:57:13,151
The lumbermill...

921
00:57:13,151 --> 00:57:15,271
It looks good only on the outside. That...

922
00:57:15,271 --> 00:57:17,821
pretty much belongs to the bank.

923
00:57:17,821 --> 00:57:19,391
On top of that,

924
00:57:21,001 --> 00:57:24,931
I think he'll find out that I've been funding the opposition party.

925
00:57:24,931 --> 00:57:27,601
And now, they're saying they'll give us the factory.

926
00:57:27,601 --> 00:57:30,651
In this situation, if he turns down the nomination,

927
00:57:30,651 --> 00:57:34,701
they probably will not leave this family alone.

928
00:57:34,701 --> 00:57:36,411
Aigoo...

929
00:57:39,211 --> 00:57:41,851
Your family and our family...

930
00:57:41,851 --> 00:57:44,351
have a special connection, you know.

931
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:52,761
With the cultivation of unified rice beginning in 1973,

932
00:57:52,761 --> 00:57:55,881
the production of our crops have increased a lot.

933
00:57:55,881 --> 00:57:58,291
However, to be independent in grain production...

934
00:58:00,511 --> 00:58:02,471
Geez, what bastard...

935
00:58:05,451 --> 00:58:07,231
Hey, asshole!

936
00:58:12,581 --> 00:58:15,811
Someday, you're going to croak.

937
00:58:21,141 --> 00:58:23,411
Was is Lee Doo Hak?

938
00:58:23,411 --> 00:58:26,741
Without him, you're no shit.

939
00:58:29,211 --> 00:58:31,521
<i>- How dare he!
- Whoa!</i>

940
00:58:36,881 --> 00:58:38,781
That bastard...

941
00:58:46,691 --> 00:58:49,051
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

942
00:58:51,131 --> 00:58:53,971
How come Young Shik isn't coming?

943
00:58:53,971 --> 00:58:55,981
He'll be here soon.

944
00:58:56,891 --> 00:58:58,761
You're sure he changed his mind, right?

945
00:58:58,761 --> 00:59:00,761
Yes.

946
00:59:00,761 --> 00:59:03,451
Mr. Choi will say he'll enter the election

947
00:59:03,451 --> 00:59:06,381
and they're the people who will work with him.

948
00:59:07,481 --> 00:59:10,021
We need to use people who have worked on elections before.

949
00:59:11,311 --> 00:59:14,631
By chance, he's not going to campaign for Minyoung Party, is he?

950
00:59:14,631 --> 00:59:19,291
That party already have decided on a candidate.

951
00:59:19,291 --> 00:59:21,051
I see.

952
00:59:21,051 --> 00:59:23,481
- Come, welcome!
- Aigoo, hello, sir!

953
00:59:23,481 --> 00:59:25,161
Hello!

954
00:59:25,161 --> 00:59:26,321
Thank you.

955
00:59:26,321 --> 00:59:28,301
Aigoo, you came!

956
00:59:28,301 --> 00:59:29,371
Aigoo...

957
00:59:29,371 --> 00:59:32,261
- Aigoo...
- He'll be the new assemblyman.

958
00:59:32,261 --> 00:59:34,511
Our new assemblyman.

959
00:59:34,511 --> 00:59:37,081
I wanted to live a quiet life.

960
00:59:37,081 --> 00:59:41,401
But this world just won't leave me alone.

961
00:59:41,401 --> 00:59:44,441
So, I will...

962
00:59:44,441 --> 00:59:46,511
Although I'm lacking...

963
00:59:46,511 --> 00:59:50,841
I made up my mind to enter the assemblyman election, everyone!

964
00:59:52,871 --> 00:59:55,531
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

965
00:59:55,531 --> 00:59:57,311
<i>- Choi Young Shik!</i>
- Thank you!

966
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,541
<i>- Choi Young Shik!</i>
- Yes!

967
01:00:00,541 --> 01:00:02,111
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

968
01:00:02,111 --> 01:00:04,411
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

969
01:00:04,411 --> 01:00:08,621
<i>Everyone! Just as dripping water drops break the boulder,</i>

970
01:00:08,621 --> 01:00:12,831
although we are small in power, we'll gather our strengths

971
01:00:12,831 --> 01:00:18,521
and end this dictatorial government!

972
01:00:22,351 --> 01:00:24,031
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

973
01:00:24,031 --> 01:00:25,601
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

974
01:00:25,601 --> 01:00:27,331
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

975
01:00:27,331 --> 01:00:28,851
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

976
01:00:28,851 --> 01:00:31,061
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

977
01:00:31,061 --> 01:00:33,991
<i>Choi Young Shik!</i>

978
01:00:38,281 --> 01:00:40,171
You were correct in your assumption, Commander.

979
01:00:40,171 --> 01:00:42,581
You were right in not recommending him from the get-go.

980
01:00:42,581 --> 01:00:44,491
What did I tell you?

981
01:00:44,491 --> 01:00:48,121
I told you he'd never campaign as a Gukhan Party candidate.

982
01:00:48,121 --> 01:00:49,921
All right.

983
01:00:49,921 --> 01:00:52,971
We'll have to chew him up one nibble at a time.

984
01:01:11,167 --> 01:01:14,107
Lee Doo Hak, stop right there!

985
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:17,157
Why are you avoiding me?

986
01:01:18,027 --> 01:01:19,207
I never did that.

987
01:01:19,207 --> 01:01:22,817
But you never came to the library, and you never called me.

988
01:01:22,817 --> 01:01:24,597
I was helping out with farming.

989
01:01:25,407 --> 01:01:26,987
That's not it.

990
01:01:26,987 --> 01:01:30,547
You're avoiding me because you're embarrassed that your father was a servant.

991
01:01:31,997 --> 01:01:33,537
Go.

Lee Doo Hak, you're really a loser, aren't you?

993
01:01:44,297 --> 01:01:45,667
Is being a servant like being a traitor?

994
01:01:45,667 --> 01:01:46,837
Did he sell out his country?

995
01:01:46,837 --> 01:01:48,577
What's so embarrassing about that?

You can study hard like you are now

01:01:52,077 --> 01:01:54,897
and once you become successful, who'd look down on you?

We can't be friends if you go to an agricultural high now?
