As such, the prosecution is indicting Choi Cheol Woong with

00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:28,596
100,000 won fine for assault.

5
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:30,286
For Lee Doo Hak...

6
00:00:57,936 --> 00:00:59,126
Sorry.

7
00:00:59,126 --> 00:01:02,796
Didn't I tell you that I was going to watch a movie today?

8
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,466
I forgot.

9
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,216
I feel like you're slacking off these days.

10
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:10,196
You want me to hit you with my nunchucks?

11
00:01:10,196 --> 00:01:12,656
One of them came but the other didn't?

12
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:14,366
I should just beat these guys up!

13
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:17,566
Of course, he'll come. Just wait a bit.

14
00:01:18,446 --> 00:01:20,026
Gosh, that scared me!

15
00:01:24,216 --> 00:01:25,636
Gosh, that took me by surprise.

16
00:01:25,636 --> 00:01:27,866
Gosh, seriously!

17
00:01:30,726 --> 00:01:34,126
<i>First, I'll meet you.</i>

18
00:01:36,276 --> 00:01:38,776
<i>But with whom?</i>

19
00:01:38,796 --> 00:01:40,686
<i>I don't know. Let's wait and see for that one.</i>

20
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,406
<i>How can I pick when I've only seen you a couple times?</i>

21
00:01:42,406 --> 00:01:45,046
<i>How long are you going to wait and see?</i>

22
00:01:45,046 --> 00:01:46,366
<i>For...</i>

23
00:01:47,676 --> 00:01:49,336
<i>about a year?</i>

24
00:01:49,336 --> 00:01:52,026
<i>Until then, we can meet as friends. Happy?</i>

25
00:01:54,216 --> 00:01:58,456
He's really gotten gutsy, hasn't he?

26
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:01,676
He would dare stand up Oh Jung Shin?

27
00:02:01,676 --> 00:02:04,426
Do you think he forgot?

28
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:06,066
He forgot?

29
00:02:06,066 --> 00:02:08,076
You guys are just the same!

30
00:02:08,076 --> 00:02:09,556
What are you guys, brothers?

31
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,936
Let's just go inside by ourselves.

32
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,816
W-Wait, let's not do that.

33
00:02:12,816 --> 00:02:14,236
How about we wait for him a bit longer?

34
00:02:14,236 --> 00:02:16,996
I'm dating you! I'm not dating Cheol Woong!

35
00:02:17,926 --> 00:02:20,156
Cheol Woong doesn't know that yet...

36
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:21,636
I will tell him today.

37
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:24,436
It's already time for the movie to start. Let's just go inside.

38
00:02:28,556 --> 00:02:29,696
W-Wait.

39
00:02:30,526 --> 00:02:32,546
Gosh, I don't think we should.

40
00:02:32,546 --> 00:02:34,836
Let's look around for Cheol Woong a bit more.

41
00:02:34,836 --> 00:02:36,166
You just wait here.

42
00:02:36,166 --> 00:02:38,646
I will be right back after circling the block.

43
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,086
Hey!

44
00:02:42,026 --> 00:02:43,436
Gosh.

45
00:03:05,716 --> 00:03:08,036
Look who it is! It's Choi Cheol Woong.

46
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:16,076
<i>Come and look at our new and latest!</i>

47
00:03:16,076 --> 00:03:18,286
<i>Please come!</i>

48
00:03:42,706 --> 00:03:44,206
Aigoo... Aigoo.

49
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,446
What... Look at this bastard.

50
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,366
Where did you hide your money?

51
00:03:53,426 --> 00:03:55,126
The money...

52
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:57,176
It's my family's bank,

53
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:59,666
so try going to the bank, you bastard.

54
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,996
Gosh, look at this crazy bastard.

55
00:04:01,996 --> 00:04:05,466
Just see how he talks to a hyung.

56
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:08,936
- You haven't had enough, you bastard.
 - Cheol Woong!

57
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:12,346
- Are you okay?
- Oh, my!

58
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:13,586
Go away.

59
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:14,636
I told you to go away!

60
00:04:14,636 --> 00:04:16,176
Just leave me be!

61
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:17,716
Hey, Choi Cheol Woong.

62
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:19,006
Is she your girlfriend?

63
00:04:19,006 --> 00:04:21,706
She's so scary. Much scarier than you.

64
00:04:21,706 --> 00:04:23,676
What are you guys, thugs?

65
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:25,506
Piss off before I report you guys!

66
00:04:25,506 --> 00:04:27,776
Oh, my! Oh, my!

67
00:04:28,586 --> 00:04:31,106
Let's go, Choi Cheol Woong, please!

68
00:04:31,106 --> 00:04:32,386
Let's hurry up and go.

69
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,916
Hey.

70
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,656
Let go of me!

71
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,786
You f***ing pieces of trash!

72
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:42,046
This bitch!

73
00:04:44,026 --> 00:04:46,806
You f***ing son of a bitch!

74
00:04:48,056 --> 00:04:49,866
No, Cheol Woong! No!

75
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:51,466
Let's just report them! You can't do this!

76
00:04:51,466 --> 00:04:53,046
Put that away!

77
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:56,616
Someone save us!

78
00:05:04,886 --> 00:05:06,066
Someone save us!

79
00:05:06,066 --> 00:05:09,186
I thought educated guys wouldn't use weapons.

80
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,076
Stay still!

81
00:05:11,076 --> 00:05:16,326
I might have to start wearing a steel plate underneath my shirt.

82
00:05:19,656 --> 00:05:22,386
You try wielding a knife at me again.

83
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,956
I'll crush you then.

84
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,166
Let's go.

85
00:05:31,186 --> 00:05:32,726
Let's go!

86
00:05:35,156 --> 00:05:36,736
Are you okay?

87
00:05:37,746 --> 00:05:40,566
Are you okay? Oh, no...

88
00:05:40,566 --> 00:05:42,316
You...

89
00:05:43,486 --> 00:05:44,966
That f***ing son of a bitch!

90
00:05:44,966 --> 00:05:46,436
I'll kill him with my own hands!

91
00:05:46,436 --> 00:05:48,166
No, Cheol Woong! It's okay.

92
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,156
- Don't fight him. Let's just report him.
 - No.

93
00:05:50,156 --> 00:05:53,326
I will pay him back ten, no, a hundred times for this!

94
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,036
No, Cheol Woong.

95
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:56,666
Doo Hak will be here soon.

96
00:05:56,666 --> 00:05:58,816
Let's just go back.

97
00:06:00,046 --> 00:06:01,356
Why?

98
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:05,346
Are you telling me I should tell on them to Hyung?

99
00:06:05,346 --> 00:06:08,366
Why are you being like that when we're friends?

100
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:10,176
Friends?

101
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:13,276
Friends?

102
00:06:24,946 --> 00:06:26,226
I'm back.

103
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:28,686
Hey, you don't stop by Cheol Woong's school

104
00:06:28,686 --> 00:06:31,026
after you finish school, right?

105
00:06:31,026 --> 00:06:34,746
Oh, I went a few times, but Cheol Woong said I didn't have to come anymore.

106
00:06:45,346 --> 00:06:46,896
Cheol Woong.

107
00:06:46,896 --> 00:06:48,816
Cheol Woong!

108
00:06:49,786 --> 00:06:53,216
Let's at least go to the pharmacy to treat your wounds.

109
00:06:54,876 --> 00:06:59,516
Didn't you say we should stay friends for about a year?

110
00:07:01,986 --> 00:07:04,166
You said it.

111
00:07:05,496 --> 00:07:08,556
That you can't pick since you've only seen us a couple times.

112
00:07:10,046 --> 00:07:11,866
My feelings...

113
00:07:11,866 --> 00:07:14,436
just turned out like that.

114
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,086
I understand.

115
00:07:20,086 --> 00:07:21,536
So hurry up and go home.

116
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:24,136
Cheol Woong. Doo Hak is waiting for usâ€“

117
00:07:24,136 --> 00:07:26,836
I don't want to see the two of you today!

118
00:07:26,836 --> 00:07:28,876
That's how I feel!

119
00:07:30,206 --> 00:07:32,196
Cheol Woong!

120
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:38,886
Cheol Woong.

121
00:07:38,886 --> 00:07:40,506
It's me.

122
00:07:45,456 --> 00:07:48,166
I heard you got hurt. Did you get in a fight?

123
00:07:49,846 --> 00:07:52,416
Am I someone who would go around getting beaten up?

124
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,596
I got a bit hurt after tripping.

125
00:07:54,596 --> 00:07:56,636
Did you get hurt badly?

126
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:58,706
Let me see your wound.

127
00:07:58,706 --> 00:08:00,376
I'm fine,

128
00:08:00,376 --> 00:08:01,696
so just go.

129
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:03,386
What are you talking about?

130
00:08:04,246 --> 00:08:05,236
Come on,

131
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,456
let me see it!

132
00:08:09,316 --> 00:08:10,766
I told you I'm fine!

133
00:08:11,706 --> 00:08:14,446
Who is the bastard that hit you?

134
00:08:16,836 --> 00:08:18,856
What do you mean someone hit me?

135
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:21,626
I told you I just tripped!

136
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,386
Just leave!

137
00:08:40,106 --> 00:08:41,606
Mom.

138
00:08:41,606 --> 00:08:43,516
Why are you here?

139
00:08:43,516 --> 00:08:45,376
I was worried about the kid.

140
00:08:46,246 --> 00:08:48,036
Who did he fight with?

141
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,626
He says he just tripped.

142
00:08:53,076 --> 00:08:54,896
Do you actually believe that?

143
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:56,746
Cheol Woong is too proud

144
00:08:56,746 --> 00:09:00,176
to admit it even if he did get hit.

145
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:08,576
I told you...

146
00:09:08,576 --> 00:09:10,986
to just leave, didn't I?

147
00:09:10,986 --> 00:09:14,176
Cheol Woong, it's me.

148
00:09:17,436 --> 00:09:18,636
Hyung...

149
00:09:18,636 --> 00:09:20,356
just left a moment ago.

150
00:09:20,356 --> 00:09:22,426
It's not about that.

151
00:09:22,426 --> 00:09:25,336
I just heard that you got hurt a little bit.

152
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,146
I bought this at the market last time.

153
00:09:29,146 --> 00:09:30,566
It's made in the U.S.!

154
00:09:30,566 --> 00:09:33,006
It's really good for bruises or sprains.

155
00:09:33,006 --> 00:09:34,746
I tried using it before

156
00:09:34,746 --> 00:09:37,816
<i>and the next day, it didn't hurt at all anymore!</i>

157
00:09:37,816 --> 00:09:39,756
What are you doing here?

158
00:09:39,756 --> 00:09:40,906
Aigoo!

159
00:09:42,296 --> 00:09:44,606
Oh, it's not like that, Ma'am... Oh, no...

160
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:46,306
<i>I just heard that Cheol Woong was a bit hurt,</i>

161
00:09:46,306 --> 00:09:47,816
<i>so I was trying to give him some good ointment...</i>

162
00:09:47,816 --> 00:09:49,886
We have first aid medication at our home, too.

163
00:09:49,886 --> 00:09:51,316
Also,

164
00:09:51,316 --> 00:09:53,676
even if we are neighbors who are comfortable with one another,

165
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,236
isn't it too rude of you to come to our place at such a late hour

166
00:09:57,236 --> 00:09:59,536
without permission?

167
00:09:59,536 --> 00:10:01,596
I'm sorry.

168
00:10:02,456 --> 00:10:04,336
Doo Hak, you, too.

169
00:10:04,336 --> 00:10:06,956
Don't come by here when it's late.

170
00:10:06,956 --> 00:10:08,376
Okay.

171
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,206
Let's go.

172
00:10:12,216 --> 00:10:13,996
Just get going.

173
00:10:17,356 --> 00:10:20,706
Aigoo! I have no affection for her whatsoever!

174
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:24,526
She's so young and yet she thinks she's the wife of a lord!

175
00:10:27,236 --> 00:10:30,306
But who did Cheol Woong get beaten up by like that?

176
00:10:30,306 --> 00:10:33,636
When he was hanging out with you, things like that never happened.

177
00:10:33,636 --> 00:10:36,476
Gosh, when your father said he was sending you to agricultural high school,

178
00:10:36,476 --> 00:10:40,346
I should have done everything to stop him!

179
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:45,526
Are you upset that I went to an agricultural high school,

180
00:10:45,526 --> 00:10:48,666
or that Cheol Woong got beaten up?

181
00:10:51,406 --> 00:10:53,656
I'm upset about both.

182
00:10:53,656 --> 00:10:55,276
Both.

183
00:10:55,276 --> 00:10:56,646
Gosh.

184
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:59,586
Geez...

185
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:07,956
I'm sure I told you not to come.

186
00:11:07,956 --> 00:11:10,176
I didn't come to go with you.

187
00:11:10,176 --> 00:11:13,516
Jung Shin said she really needs to see you tonight.

188
00:11:13,516 --> 00:11:14,776
She says she has something to tell you.

189
00:11:16,106 --> 00:11:18,316
Where we ate grilled clams.

190
00:11:19,406 --> 00:11:20,686
What about you, Hyung?

191
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:24,116
I'll come later.

192
00:11:37,286 --> 00:11:39,486
I'm ashamed of myself, Oppa.

193
00:11:39,486 --> 00:11:41,486
He's quite an amazing man.

194
00:11:41,486 --> 00:11:43,016
But...

195
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:46,486
he would reject our nomination and run independently?

196
00:11:46,486 --> 00:11:49,696
I know it's like hitting your head against a brick wall.

197
00:11:49,696 --> 00:11:52,276
I'm going to do whatever I can to make him reconsider.

198
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:53,956
We don't even have money,

199
00:11:53,956 --> 00:11:55,746
so how could he run independent of a party...

200
00:11:56,506 --> 00:12:00,016
He kicked aside a feast table laid out for him. How would you stop him?

201
00:12:00,016 --> 00:12:04,466
Madam Kang, you are going through a lot after marrying a lofty-minded man.

202
00:12:04,466 --> 00:12:07,136
Okay. You can go now.

203
00:12:09,446 --> 00:12:11,296
And take this with you.

204
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:14,866
- No, how could I?
- Just take it.

205
00:12:14,866 --> 00:12:19,346
This is probably the money you gathered from your emergency funds.

206
00:12:19,346 --> 00:12:20,976
You should use it to provide for your household.

207
00:12:20,976 --> 00:12:22,876
No, Iâ€“

208
00:12:27,276 --> 00:12:29,136
I'm sorry, Oppa.

209
00:12:56,456 --> 00:12:59,506
What's the likelihood that Choi Young Shik will be elected?

210
00:12:59,506 --> 00:13:01,026
Well...

211
00:13:01,026 --> 00:13:04,596
I also spoke with the KCIA.

212
00:13:04,596 --> 00:13:08,636
- What did they say?
 - It's likely that he will receive more than 30% of the votes.

213
00:13:08,636 --> 00:13:10,896
<i>So it's possible he wins the election in first place.</i>

214
00:13:11,896 --> 00:13:13,066
<i>Really?</i>

215
00:13:13,936 --> 00:13:16,686
<i>He's got such a following in the region as a familiar face,</i>

216
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:19,556
<i>and he's got the afterglow of his father being a leader of the independence movement.</i>

217
00:13:20,536 --> 00:13:23,046
Have you looked into his weaknesses?

218
00:13:23,046 --> 00:13:26,516
His history with both his business and women are clean.

219
00:13:28,706 --> 00:13:32,906
If you had not done something about it in advance,

220
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:35,316
it would have been quite the headache, Commander.

221
00:13:43,806 --> 00:13:45,876
I am Ki Young Tak.

222
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:51,396
Do you want to get expelled and go to prison?

223
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:56,416
I'm sorry!

224
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,966
I won't ever bully these guys again.

225
00:13:58,966 --> 00:14:02,366
I mean it, I swear!

226
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:04,806
What?

227
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:14,276
That's not what you need to do.

228
00:14:19,236 --> 00:14:20,766
You know this guy, right?

229
00:14:21,586 --> 00:14:23,156
Oh, yes.

230
00:14:23,156 --> 00:14:25,846
He always goes everywhere

231
00:14:25,846 --> 00:14:27,826
with the guy he calls Hyung.

232
00:14:27,826 --> 00:14:29,756
Choi Cheol Woong.

233
00:14:29,756 --> 00:14:31,076
Yes.

234
00:14:31,076 --> 00:14:35,336
Well, all you have to do is get beat up by Choi Cheol Woong a bit.

235
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:38,516
If you bleed, even better.

236
00:14:38,516 --> 00:14:39,956
Excuse me?

237
00:14:43,946 --> 00:14:45,066
Geez...

238
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:46,206
Seriously.

239
00:14:46,206 --> 00:14:48,006
Yeah, yeah.

240
00:14:48,006 --> 00:14:50,266
You don't love me?

241
00:14:50,266 --> 00:14:52,926
Gosh, this bastard.

242
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,776
How could you turn your back on me?

243
00:14:54,776 --> 00:14:56,596
Gosh, this bastard, seriously!

244
00:14:56,596 --> 00:14:57,916
He's so weak!

245
00:14:57,916 --> 00:14:59,716
I'm going to go throw up.

246
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,016
Damn it.

247
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,436
What's this?

248
00:15:29,436 --> 00:15:31,216
Jung Shin isn't coming.

249
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,596
Also,

250
00:15:32,596 --> 00:15:35,036
I heard what this bastard did.

251
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,926
Did I ever tell you to do this, Hyung?

252
00:15:39,866 --> 00:15:44,586
I was going to beat him up even without your help, Hyung.

253
00:15:44,586 --> 00:15:48,006
What, you think I would lose?

254
00:15:48,006 --> 00:15:51,626
Do you think that I would lose to someone like him?

255
00:15:51,626 --> 00:15:53,916
Hurry up and ask for his forgiveness.

256
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:57,126
And tell him that you won't ever bother him again.

257
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:59,136
Are you joking?

258
00:16:00,036 --> 00:16:03,156
You're a man and yet you bring someone else because you can't beat me on your own?

259
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,866
You retard.

260
00:16:04,866 --> 00:16:07,396
Hey, Ki Young Ta. What did you say, you bastard?

261
00:16:07,396 --> 00:16:09,216
Forget it.

262
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,886
You should stay out of this, Hyung.

263
00:16:12,546 --> 00:16:14,446
Cheol Woong.

264
00:16:14,446 --> 00:16:16,026
You should stop.

265
00:16:16,026 --> 00:16:18,726
He already got beaten up enough by me.

266
00:16:18,726 --> 00:16:20,576
I told you to move aside.

267
00:16:20,576 --> 00:16:22,246
No?

268
00:16:22,246 --> 00:16:24,016
What are you going to do?

269
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,676
I can get over me getting hit,

270
00:16:28,066 --> 00:16:29,676
but this bastard...

271
00:16:29,676 --> 00:16:32,356
This bastard hit Jung Shin!

272
00:16:33,466 --> 00:16:35,876
Even I can't forgive him,

273
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:39,066
so you shouldn't forgive him all the more!

274
00:16:39,066 --> 00:16:41,156
Since you guys decided to go out,

275
00:16:41,156 --> 00:16:43,176
isn't that right?

276
00:16:45,586 --> 00:16:48,716
Did Jung Shin really get hit by this bastard?

277
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,746
Hey, Ki Young Tak.

278
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,036
It's great not having your minions here.

279
00:16:57,036 --> 00:17:00,656
I will fight you one-on-one, fair and square.

280
00:17:00,656 --> 00:17:04,286
If you win, I'll give you my money too.

281
00:17:04,286 --> 00:17:06,926
But if you lose, you will die here,

282
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:08,516
you got that?

283
00:17:10,216 --> 00:17:11,926
You talk too much.

284
00:17:19,096 --> 00:17:21,056
- Hey.
 - Let go of me!

285
00:17:21,056 --> 00:17:23,436
You can't beat me.

286
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:31,426
- Fight me.
 - Get up, you bastard.

287
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:32,596
No?

288
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:34,726
I told you to get up!

289
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,426
Don't come over here!

290
00:17:47,426 --> 00:17:50,576
If you get involved, I won't hold back even if you're my hyung.

291
00:18:08,136 --> 00:18:12,716
People like you who fools around trusting others

292
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:16,586
to bail them out are so disgusting.

293
00:18:19,106 --> 00:18:21,196
Don't ever act like you're all that

294
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:24,046
in front of that girl.

295
00:18:30,656 --> 00:18:32,726
Are we finshed here?

296
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:34,486
I can go now, right?

297
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:47,046
Cheol Woong!

298
00:18:52,126 --> 00:18:55,186
Get up and fight me again!

299
00:18:55,186 --> 00:18:57,566
I told you to get up.

300
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:02,876
Ki Young Tak, wake up.

301
00:19:02,876 --> 00:19:05,006
Young Tak!

302
00:19:08,996 --> 00:19:11,806
W-What's this...

303
00:19:15,346 --> 00:19:17,066
Is he dead?

304
00:19:38,316 --> 00:19:39,856
Hey, Young Tak!

305
00:19:39,856 --> 00:19:41,486
Ki Young Tak!

306
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:42,986
Gosh, damn it!

307
00:19:42,986 --> 00:19:44,486
Doctor!

308
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:47,356
Yeosu Police Station received a call from a hospital.

309
00:19:47,356 --> 00:19:51,026
Two students brought in an injured Ki Young Tak on their shoulders,

310
00:19:51,026 --> 00:19:53,326
and he's currently in a coma.

311
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:02,286
He won't die, right?

312
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:06,696
Hyung, people don't die that easily, right?

313
00:20:07,546 --> 00:20:09,036
He won't die.

314
00:20:09,036 --> 00:20:11,326
He'll definitely live.

315
00:20:12,346 --> 00:20:13,796
Cheol Woong.

316
00:20:15,036 --> 00:20:16,806
Let's turn ourselves in.

317
00:20:16,806 --> 00:20:19,546
Even if he were to survive, we should pay the consequence.

318
00:20:22,766 --> 00:20:24,446
Hyung.

319
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,716
I didn't do anything wrong.

320
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:28,266
This is self-defense.

321
00:20:28,266 --> 00:20:29,936
Okay,

322
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:32,606
so let's go to the police station and tell them.

323
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,156
I-I can't!

324
00:20:34,156 --> 00:20:36,036
I won't go!

325
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,366
Also,

326
00:20:39,366 --> 00:20:41,326
is this my fault?

327
00:20:41,326 --> 00:20:44,256
When did I ever tell you to bring that bastard Young Tak to me?

328
00:20:44,256 --> 00:20:46,046
You tricked me by lying to me.

329
00:20:46,046 --> 00:20:48,086
You said Jung Shin wanted to see me.

330
00:20:48,086 --> 00:20:49,886
Didn't you bring that bastard knowing full well

331
00:20:49,886 --> 00:20:53,686
that I would do something to him if you brought him?

332
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:57,536
So, all of this is your fault, Hyung.

333
00:20:57,536 --> 00:20:59,436
Am I wrong?

334
00:21:00,586 --> 00:21:03,466
I asked if I'm wrong!

335
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,926
You're right.

336
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:11,696
I guess this was all my fault.

337
00:21:11,696 --> 00:21:13,816
It's all my fault.

338
00:21:22,276 --> 00:21:23,626
No...

339
00:21:25,186 --> 00:21:27,656
I must have lost it just then.

340
00:21:27,656 --> 00:21:31,166
I'm the one who struck him with a rock.

341
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,316
All you did

342
00:21:33,346 --> 00:21:35,926
was try to help me, Hyung...

343
00:21:35,926 --> 00:21:37,446
Right?

344
00:21:40,786 --> 00:21:42,076
Hyung...

345
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,936
I'm so scared.

346
00:21:45,896 --> 00:21:47,576
If that bastard dies,

347
00:21:47,576 --> 00:21:50,716
then I would become a murderer and go to prison.

348
00:21:50,716 --> 00:21:54,076
And my father's bid to become an assemblyman? Forget that! He'll face public shame.

349
00:21:54,076 --> 00:21:58,606
And my mother, who sees me as her only hope, will collapse.

350
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:01,076
What should I do, Hyung?

351
00:22:01,076 --> 00:22:02,876
What do I do?

352
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,336
Hyung.

353
00:22:12,566 --> 00:22:16,606
Can't you please save me just this once?

354
00:22:16,606 --> 00:22:22,166
Can't you tell them that you were the one who hit Young Tak with a rock, instead of me?

355
00:22:25,276 --> 00:22:26,686
Cheol Woong...

356
00:22:27,986 --> 00:22:30,796
Hyung. Hyung, Hyung!

357
00:22:31,906 --> 00:22:33,676
Please save me.

358
00:22:34,836 --> 00:22:36,826
If you do this for me just this once,

359
00:22:36,826 --> 00:22:38,786
I will take responsibility for your life!

360
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:40,096
No,

361
00:22:40,096 --> 00:22:42,196
I will devote my life to becoming successful

362
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,466
and I'll give you everything I have.

363
00:22:44,466 --> 00:22:46,126
I know, Hyung,

364
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:49,136
that you always gave up a lot for me.

365
00:22:49,136 --> 00:22:51,706
But really, I'll let you live in first place

366
00:22:51,706 --> 00:22:53,886
instead of me.

367
00:22:53,886 --> 00:22:55,846
Hyung...

368
00:22:55,846 --> 00:22:59,446
Please save me this once!

369
00:23:03,066 --> 00:23:04,386
Hyung...

370
00:23:08,676 --> 00:23:11,216
Why do I have to do that?

371
00:23:13,056 --> 00:23:14,816
You're the one who did that,

372
00:23:14,816 --> 00:23:17,396
so why do I have to take the blame?

373
00:23:19,966 --> 00:23:21,566
Both my father

374
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,066
and I

375
00:23:23,066 --> 00:23:25,946
lived like your servants all our lives!

376
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:30,726
Why do I have to take blame for something like this as well!

377
00:23:32,366 --> 00:23:33,886
Is it fine for you to live

378
00:23:33,886 --> 00:23:36,156
and for me to die?

379
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,766
Is your life a human life,

380
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:42,276
and my life a dog's or a pig's life?

381
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,456
Hey.

382
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:54,386
What are you doing not going to bed?

383
00:24:11,906 --> 00:24:13,606
Ahjussi,

384
00:24:13,606 --> 00:24:14,756
if something goes wrong with Cheol Woong,

385
00:24:14,756 --> 00:24:18,186
then both me and my husband, and our entire family will die.

386
00:24:18,186 --> 00:24:20,786
I'm begging you. Please save him...

387
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:22,286
You're my only hope, Ahjussi.

388
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:25,376
The only one who can save our familyâ€“
 - Ma'am!

389
00:24:25,376 --> 00:24:27,636
I've never said no to anything

390
00:24:27,636 --> 00:24:30,636
you have requested of me.

391
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,086
But...

392
00:24:32,086 --> 00:24:34,176
But this...

393
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:35,906
I don't think this is right.

394
00:24:35,906 --> 00:24:37,826
How could I do that to Doo Hak

395
00:24:37,826 --> 00:24:40,396
- just to save Cheol Woong!
 - Ahjussi!

396
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,436
Once my husband gets elected,

397
00:24:42,436 --> 00:24:44,176
he will make sure he gets out of prison in no time.

398
00:24:44,176 --> 00:24:46,706
I will make sure that happens!

399
00:24:46,706 --> 00:24:50,206
I will make sure to hire the best lawyer available...

400
00:24:50,206 --> 00:24:51,876
Ahjussi...

401
00:24:51,876 --> 00:24:56,526
If my husband loses the election, we will all die.

402
00:24:56,526 --> 00:24:58,566
Only if he wins the election will we all live.

403
00:24:58,566 --> 00:25:01,646
Please, I beg you! Save us!

404
00:25:01,646 --> 00:25:03,946
Save us, Ahjussi...

405
00:25:03,946 --> 00:25:05,806
Gosh, damn it...

406
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:13,286
Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

407
00:25:13,286 --> 00:25:15,056
No, Ahjussi, please!

408
00:25:15,056 --> 00:25:17,526
Save us, Ahjussi, please!

409
00:25:17,526 --> 00:25:20,206
No, Ahjussi!

410
00:25:20,206 --> 00:25:21,336
Let me go!

411
00:25:21,336 --> 00:25:23,046
- No!
 - Ahjussi, Ahjussi!

412
00:25:23,046 --> 00:25:24,036
Ahjussi!

413
00:25:24,036 --> 00:25:25,886
Aigoo...

414
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,446
No, no! Ahjussi!

415
00:25:28,446 --> 00:25:29,866
<i>Ahjussi!</i>

416
00:25:29,866 --> 00:25:33,366
I'm really sorry!

417
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:34,556
Just this once...

418
00:25:34,556 --> 00:25:37,096
Please save me just this once!

419
00:25:37,096 --> 00:25:40,046
Please save me this once!

420
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:43,516
Please save me this once!

421
00:25:43,516 --> 00:25:44,876
Ahjussi...

422
00:25:48,436 --> 00:25:51,926
Gosh, damn it, you bastard!

423
00:25:53,126 --> 00:25:57,196
Why did you do this, you bastard!

424
00:25:58,186 --> 00:26:01,476
Why did you do that...

425
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:04,606
- Ahjussi!
 - Please, just this once...

426
00:26:04,606 --> 00:26:08,146
Please save me just this once...

427
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,276
Doo Hak...

428
00:26:39,726 --> 00:26:41,636
Wait!

429
00:26:44,906 --> 00:26:46,816
You must have made a mistake and came.

430
00:26:46,816 --> 00:26:50,106
My son is definitely not someone who would do that.

431
00:26:50,106 --> 00:26:53,276
Please look into it again before you come.

432
00:26:53,276 --> 00:26:55,226
We're going to question him when we get to the police station,

433
00:26:55,226 --> 00:26:58,296
so just wait a bit.
 - What do you mean, question him!

434
00:26:58,296 --> 00:27:00,566
You can ask everyone in this neighborhood,

435
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:03,826
if there is anybody as studious and upright like my Doo Hak!

436
00:27:03,826 --> 00:27:07,776
If you keep doing this, I'll also bring you in for obstruction of justice!

437
00:27:07,776 --> 00:27:09,966
Go ahead! Go ahead and bring me in!

438
00:27:09,966 --> 00:27:10,886
Bring me in too!

439
00:27:10,886 --> 00:27:13,106
You can't take my child!

440
00:27:13,106 --> 00:27:14,296
You can't!

441
00:27:14,296 --> 00:27:16,726
Doo Hak, hurry up and tell them it's not you!

442
00:27:16,726 --> 00:27:20,196
Tell them that you did nothing wrong!

443
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:23,896
Gosh, this is going to drive me nuts.

444
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:27,086
Hey, Officer Kim and Officer Park! Why aren't you doing anything?

445
00:27:27,966 --> 00:27:29,776
Gosh, seriously.

446
00:27:48,006 --> 00:27:49,406
Doo Hak...

447
00:27:49,406 --> 00:27:51,536
Doo Hak, what's going on?

448
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:55,016
Gosh, what's with this girl now?

449
00:27:55,016 --> 00:27:56,306
It's not you, right?

450
00:27:56,306 --> 00:27:59,066
You would never do something like that. Right?

451
00:28:00,656 --> 00:28:02,026
Hey, Lee Doo Hak!

452
00:28:02,026 --> 00:28:03,386
Look into my eyes and tell me.

453
00:28:03,386 --> 00:28:06,556
You're not the type of guy who would do that. Right?

454
00:28:06,556 --> 00:28:09,006
It's not you!

455
00:28:09,006 --> 00:28:10,616
Please step aside.

456
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:12,146
Please wait!

457
00:28:12,146 --> 00:28:14,576
Lee Doo Hak! Lee Doo Hak!

458
00:28:17,396 --> 00:28:20,036
Doo Hak, Doo Hak.

459
00:28:20,036 --> 00:28:22,136
Cheol Woong, Cheol Woong, you know it, right?

460
00:28:22,136 --> 00:28:24,086
Doo Hak isn't someone who would do that.

461
00:28:24,086 --> 00:28:26,356
Choi Cheol Woong, Lee Doo Hak!

462
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:28,716
Answer me!

463
00:28:29,946 --> 00:28:32,786
Please, just a moment! Guys... Just a moment!

464
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,366
<i>Doo Hak!</i>

465
00:28:34,366 --> 00:28:37,006
Doo Hak!

466
00:28:46,706 --> 00:28:48,686
<i>Doo Hak!</i>

467
00:28:50,686 --> 00:28:52,226
Doo Hak...

468
00:28:54,036 --> 00:28:55,726
do not...

469
00:28:57,286 --> 00:28:59,576
forgive your father...

470
00:29:02,476 --> 00:29:04,896
Doo Hak! You can't take my child away!

471
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,846
You can't take my child away!

472
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:09,206
No, you can't! You can't take him!

473
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:10,316
You can't do this!

474
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,196
- Mom!
 - Doo Hak...

475
00:29:12,196 --> 00:29:14,096
- Mom!
 - Doo Hak...

476
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:15,746
Doo Hak!

477
00:29:15,746 --> 00:29:17,646
- Doo Hak!
- Mom! I'm sorry...

478
00:29:17,646 --> 00:29:19,586
Doo Hak...

479
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,206
Those mean bastards...

480
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:23,386
Take me with you!

481
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,846
You can't take my child away...

482
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:33,546
What? His friend confessed to the crime?

483
00:29:33,546 --> 00:29:35,506
Yes, his name is Lee Doo Hak.

484
00:29:35,506 --> 00:29:38,256
He testified that when he saw Choi Cheol Woong get severely beat up in his fight with Ki Young Tak,

485
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:41,116
he struck Ki Young Tak with a rock.

486
00:29:41,116 --> 00:29:42,556
No! This won't do!

487
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:45,806
Lee Doo Hak is useless to me!

488
00:29:45,806 --> 00:29:48,536
Keep delaying the court date until after the election.

489
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:52,186
We need to turn Choi Cheol Woong, the son of Choi Young Shik, into a murder accomplice.

490
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:53,616
Understood.

491
00:29:53,616 --> 00:29:56,576
- Kim Wang Geun, Kim Wang Geun!
 - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam!
 - Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

492
00:29:56,576 --> 00:29:58,406
- Kim Wang Geun, Kim Wang Geun!
 - Lee Jeong Nam, Lee Jeong Nam!
 - Choi Young Shik, Choi Young Shik!

493
00:29:58,406 --> 00:30:00,086
I am Candidate 2, Kim Wang Geun!

494
00:30:05,316 --> 00:30:06,826
Everyone!

495
00:30:06,826 --> 00:30:12,136
Should we not end the totalitarian regime this time

496
00:30:12,136 --> 00:30:17,156
and move towards the democracy we long for, everyone?

But supposedly, Cheol Woong only ended up receiving a beating.

00:41:27,790 --> 00:41:29,980
looks like we'll have to watch the movie next time.

663
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:32,720
Don't ever make it known that you know me, okay?

664
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:37,170
Get that bastard!

665
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,140
Hey, get that assholeâ€”

666
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,680
I see you got promoted.

667
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,670
Are you going to Seoul?

668
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,130
Yes.

669
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,550
I plan to transfer to reserve force soon after.

670
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,810
Why?

671
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:06,420
It's well known that the elder favors you a lot, Oppa.

672
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,670
I'm sick of wandering all my life and

673
00:42:08,670 --> 00:42:10,510
the world has changed as well.

674
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,890
Sir keeps telling me to take charge of a different job.

675
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,640
What kind of?

676
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,460
Later.

677
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,960
I don't think I'll be able to visit too often once I go up.

678
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:38,230
Hang in there.

679
00:42:38,230 --> 00:42:40,680
Contact me if you have any problems.

680
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,810
Okay.

681
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:46,680
[Let's not buy illegal tickets that undermine social order.]
[Soonyang Theater in Gwangju]

682
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,890
[Bushman]

683
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:08,200
Was your visit to Seoul all right, Boss?

684
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,090
Are we getting any customers?

685
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:12,770
As you see, we're selling out every day.

686
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:15,180
The audience are totally loving it!

687
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,170
Anyhow, just like "Raiders,"

688
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:19,380
if we just say the Hollywood punks made it,

689
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,230
it's bound to be a daebak!

690
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:25,040
It's an African movie, you idiot.

691
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,370
By the way, the print is too worn out.

692
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:57,190
So I think we'll have to cut out at least 10 minutes of it.

693
00:43:57,190 --> 00:44:01,180
How much screen time do you think will remain when we send it down, then?

694
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:04,470
Since we need to cut out about 20 minutes out of 109 minutes,

695
00:44:04,470 --> 00:44:07,320
there should be about 90 minutes left.

696
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:10,430
Will the audience understand the story, then?

697
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,070
Don't cut out too much and

698
00:44:12,070 --> 00:44:13,600
just send it out as it is.

699
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:15,150
I understand.

700
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,040
- Director Go!
- Oh, my!

701
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:21,390
You're back again?

702
00:44:21,390 --> 00:44:24,460
I must get the print today, no matter what.

703
00:44:24,460 --> 00:44:26,980
What's the deal with this little girl?

704
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,410
Who are you, Ahjumma?

705
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:30,680
If you don't want to get hurt, stay out of this.

706
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,060
How dare this little girlâ€”

707
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:33,820
Move aside!

708
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,640
I'm sorry. Please come this way.

709
00:44:39,230 --> 00:44:40,670
Okay!

710
00:44:40,670 --> 00:44:43,020
- Without spending a penny, you'll get a lot of...
- H-Hey!

711
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,700
advertising tomorrow on the news about the theater!

712
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:46,870
What are you doing right now?

713
00:44:46,870 --> 00:44:48,500
Is your nose not working?

714
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,310
Don't you smell something pungent?

715
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,870
Whoaâ€” Have you gone mad?

716
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,100
Yes.

717
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:56,430
I've gone mad.

718
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:58,420
You won't listen to me when I talk sanely,

719
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,360
so I need to go insane. Am I wrong?

720
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,270
Wh-Whoa! Put that match down right now!

721
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,180
Are you going to give it...

722
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,470
or not?

723
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,980
Darling.

724
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:11,680
The matches must be wet.

725
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,550
Use that.

726
00:45:14,550 --> 00:45:16,870
It's guaranteed to light.

727
00:45:16,870 --> 00:45:18,530
It's made in the U.S.A.

728
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,390
She's gone mad, huh?

729
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:26,620
Are you going to give it to me or not?

730
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:31,090
Oh, you're the daughter of Namhae Theater's Mr. Oh?

731
00:45:31,090 --> 00:45:33,770
I did hear your father passed away.

732
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:39,790
I felt really bad for not being able to attend the funeral because I was in Seoul back then.

733
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,340
- Director Go.
- Yes.

734
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,520
You attended, right?

735
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:46,360
Well, the thing is...

736
00:45:46,360 --> 00:45:48,980
I was also busy, so...

737
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:53,130
Is that so?

738
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:58,160
Well, you are always busy with something, Director Go.

739
00:45:59,350 --> 00:46:00,930
So the short story is

740
00:46:00,930 --> 00:46:03,940
you paid for half of the sale price of "Bushman,"

741
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,200
and you were to pay the rest today,

742
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,680
but you're going to pay up after showing it in Yeosu since your finances are in trouble?

743
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,190
That's what you're saying, right?

744
00:46:11,190 --> 00:46:12,390
Yes.

745
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,790
- Director Go.
- Yes.

746
00:46:15,790 --> 00:46:18,520
Did our distributing agency ever do that?

747
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:21,470
It has never happened before and will never happen in the future, either.

748
00:46:21,470 --> 00:46:24,470
- Don't use fancy words.
- Okay.

749
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,130
How unfortunate, Young Lady?

750
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,200
He said it won't work.

751
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,280
Will you lend me that lighter again?

752
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,620
Oh, my. Th-This wickedâ€”

753
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:42,440
- Director Go.
- Yes.

754
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,670
As soon as we're done with the showing,

755
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:46,720
give her the "Bushman" prints.

756
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,800
Sorry?

757
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:51,060
Give it to her.

758
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:52,070
O-Okay, Boss.

759
00:46:52,070 --> 00:46:54,370
Boss, thank you so much.

760
00:46:54,370 --> 00:46:55,810
Thank you so much, really!

761
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:57,920
I won't ever forget your favor.

762
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,010
Take your leave.

763
00:47:00,010 --> 00:47:01,700
Thank you.

764
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,530
Wait, Boss...

765
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,670
Why are you doing something you don't usually do?

766
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,580
Hey, you asshole.

767
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:17,760
Take 20% off since the print is already worn out.

768
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,750
And if we take 30% off for not doing our duties as human beings, skipping out on the funeral,

769
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,950
we don't need to get the remaining balance.

770
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,240
Do you still think yourself human?

771
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,610
- This little...
- My, my. It hurts.

772
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:29,000
- It hurts so much.
- Also...

773
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:30,760
two years ago, I'm sure

774
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,920
you wrote in the ledger 50,000 won as an expense for condolence payment for Mr. Oh.

775
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,730
You embezzled that money, didn't you, you bastard?

776
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,950
Whoa, Boss...

777
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:44,220
Gosh, this little...

778
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:49,260
It hurts.

779
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:09,990
Boss...

780
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,910
You're coming now?

781
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:19,800
Why are you sitting there, Uncle?

782
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:25,030
The chair was so nice and comfy,

783
00:48:25,030 --> 00:48:27,920
so I was just getting a feel.

784
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,540
Having competence makes you a boss,

785
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,660
not just sitting in the boss' seat.

786
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:36,380
Honey, why would you say something like that?

787
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,310
Jung Shin works so hard to keep this theater alive.

788
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,150
So did it come alive?

789
00:48:43,150 --> 00:48:45,080
I got the "Bushman" print,

790
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,050
so I'll be able to pay back a portion.

791
00:48:47,050 --> 00:48:48,780
Please take your leave now.

792
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,990
A portion?

793
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,450
How much of a portion?

794
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:54,810
Are you even doing your accounting right?

795
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,810
Your father alone took 50 million won!

796
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,340
I'll pay back whatever it is, 50 million or 100 million!

797
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,580
So take your leave now.

798
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,190
How dare you raise your voice?

799
00:49:05,190 --> 00:49:06,950
- Huh?
- Gosh.

800
00:49:06,950 --> 00:49:10,740
You have nothing to say even if I say this theater is mine right now.

801
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,150
Gosh, Honey.

802
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,420
She said she'll pay us back.

803
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:17,180
It's not like we're loan sharks.

804
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,030
We can't be doing this

805
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,140
to another family member.

806
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:23,500
You have no idea what that money means to me.

807
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:27,410
Because our father left all of his inheritance to Oppa,

808
00:49:27,410 --> 00:49:29,440
I had to work like a dog and an ox to

809
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,870
make that money, not spending a single penny!

810
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:36,490
Is that why you're playing with interest like a dog and an ox?

811
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,780
- What?
- I paid back...

812
00:49:38,780 --> 00:49:41,900
more than the principal amount in interest already, Aunt.

813
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:43,420
It was secured as a collateral anyway,

814
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:45,250
so if I fail to pay you back later,

815
00:49:45,250 --> 00:49:47,080
you can take this theater.

816
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,200
But please take your leave now, I said!

817
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,830
You're finally showing your true colors!

818
00:49:56,830 --> 00:49:58,250
All right.

819
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:00,960
If you don't pay me back within this year,

820
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:03,650
- this theater is mine!
- Aigoo, let's go. Come on.

821
00:50:03,650 --> 00:50:07,170
How dare she raise her voice when she owes us money?

822
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,500
What has this world come to that

823
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,710
scammers and debtors are so shameless?

824

What about Cheol Woong?

827
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,500
I waited at the station all this time,

828
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:44,310
but I haven't seen him still.

829
00:50:46,760 --> 00:50:48,060
What could be the matter?

830
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:50,490
He said he'll be  coming down for sure, though.

So I'll go out to the station one more time and wait.
