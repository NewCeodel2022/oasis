00:00:36,029 --> 00:00:37,229
He should be here
any minute now, right?

5
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:39,029
That's him. He's here.

6
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:43,639
Okay.

7
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:48,279
Sir, you look like
you've lost a lot of weight.

8
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:50,779
I bet you've lost your appetite
because of Assemblyperson Ko.

9
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,779
- That jerk.
- I just said that...

10
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:53,980
- He's so thorough.
- the meeting was taking too long...

11
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:57,050
because of the chatty ladies. How
exactly does that belittle women?

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,219
They have the nerve
to mess with the party leader.

13
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:03,130
So, what do you plan to do
with Assemblyperson Ko?

14
00:01:03,459 --> 00:01:06,160
I called you over, Mr. No,
to pick your brains.

15
00:01:08,929 --> 00:01:10,329
Send him off in one fell swoop.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,100
Bring it to me on paper.

17
00:01:12,399 --> 00:01:14,800
I'll read it over a meal next week.

22
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:28,949
You want something more powerful.

23
00:01:28,949 --> 00:01:30,720
Nothing should be done sloppily.

24
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,759
You don't want to do
a sloppy job either.

25
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:34,020
Never.

26
00:01:34,589 --> 00:01:35,759
It's good to be sure.

27

What were you discussing
with No Ji Ho, a KBM reporter?

30

Barging in like this.

31
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:04,589
Don't you think it's rude?

32
00:02:04,589 --> 00:02:07,459
I listened to a past recording
of you and Mr. No.

33
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:10,259
You two agreed to meet next week.

34
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:12,259
Am I right?

35
00:02:15,559 --> 00:02:17,430
You typed up an article already?

36
00:02:17,669 --> 00:02:19,169
Did you and Assemblyman Mo...

37
00:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,940
decide to get rid
of Assemblyperson Ko?

38
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,639
No.

39
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:25,539
A party representative...

40
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,609
asked a reporter
to write a certain article?

41
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:30,049
I'm giving you a chance
to explain yourself.

42
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,650
Do you have nothing to say?

43
00:02:32,949 --> 00:02:35,949
You're saying I incited him
to write something just because...

44
00:02:35,949 --> 00:02:37,150
we met in private?

45
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,560
Aren't you trying
a bit too hard to frame me?

46
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:43,829
Isn't this a conspiracy?

47
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,600
You met a week ago
to discuss something,

48
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,900
and the reporter brought you
a typed-up article.

49
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,470
You're even suggesting
what and how to air.

50
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,370
Wouldn't you call this colluding?

51
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:00,509
You really are feisty
and relentless.

52
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,650
I see why Chairman Seol
worries about his daughter-in-law.

53
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:07,150
Too bad.

54
00:03:07,579 --> 00:03:10,190
Once my father-in-law
sees this broadcast,

55
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,120
he'll have to worry about
a friend too.

on the long-standing problem...

58

of the collusion
of politics and journalism.

59

They say politicians
and journalists...

60

must always keep their distance.

61
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:42,120
They should never be too close,
but never too far apart.

shows in their article,

shows in their actions.

to stay close to Assemblyman Mo.

you went after him, isn't it?

00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:52,149
I need you to trust me
so I can get him sooner.

166
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:53,690
Do you trust me?

167
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,659
Tae Heon, convince the criminal,

168
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,330
not the hostage.

169
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:06,300
- Shoot.
- What?

170
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,340
Shoot.

171
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,810
- Are you talking to me?
- Shoot above his head.

172
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:12,540
- Okay.
- You don't even have a gun.

173
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,379
You'll die because of him.

174
00:10:14,379 --> 00:10:16,379
Now!

175
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,379
Darn you!

176
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:46,109
Come along.

177
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,350
I want to sleep. Turn it off.

178
00:10:54,649 --> 00:10:57,090
How can I turn off something so fun?

179
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,420
Then watch it somewhere else.

180
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:00,220
Hey, Ace, I heard you scored.

181
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,489
I did the shooting, though.

182
00:11:02,019 --> 00:11:05,029
Stop getting on my nerves
and just go home and sleep.

183
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:06,529
- Gosh.
- Hello.

184
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,259
- "Nothing Uncovered" begins now.
- Why do you have to sound so rude?

185
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,269
- An influential politician...
- Too bad I can't curse at you.

186
00:11:12,269 --> 00:11:14,340
- Go ahead and see what I do.
- and a reporter...

187
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,739
The politician and the reporter
are denying that...

188
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,739
they know each other.

189
00:11:17,739 --> 00:11:19,570
In fact,
the back-scratching alliance...

190
00:11:19,570 --> 00:11:21,040
of politicians and the press...

191
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,409
is difficult to prove.

192
00:11:22,409 --> 00:11:24,409
("Nothing Uncovered")

193
00:11:23,409 --> 00:11:25,509
However,
"Nothing Uncovered" was able...

194
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:26,550
- Gosh. She said she'd be...
- to expose the alliance...

195
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,580
- the top reporter in three years.
- between Assemblyman Mo...

196
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,820
And she kept her word.

197
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,389
- and a certain reporter...
- She's so cool.

198
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:31,690
through this video.

199
00:11:37,190 --> 00:11:38,389
I got the money through
the wire transfer.

200
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,659
But why do you not want to use
what we found on Mo Hyung Taek?

201
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,269
It was a peripheral hit,
not a direct hit.

202
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,300
Look into the stock scammer too.

203
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,800
So no signs of Lee Yi Jin yet,
right?

204
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,239
Come on. You know how it goes.
What's up with the question?

205
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,639
You know that I get insecure
when my episodes air.

206
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:57,680
Your episode was a hit.
You should learn to enjoy the win.

207
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,550
That's how people end up
ruining their careers.

208
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,379
Are you busy these days?

209
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:03,649
That's a yellow card.
No questions about my personal life.

210
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:06,149
This loner act of yours is making me
want to look into you even more.

211
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,029
You know that you won't get anything
even if you try.

212
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,529
Bye.

213
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,109
Good work.

214
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,249
You should have waited inside.
You didn't have to come out.

215
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:42,389
Well, I was sick of always waiting
for my busy wife inside.

216
00:12:42,859 --> 00:12:45,590
Hey, that was some truth to it.
You're dissing me, right?

217
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,529
You seem tired.

218
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,700
Let me give you a piggyback ride.

219
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:52,869
- Get up.
- I'll give you a piggyback ride.

220
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,869
- Yes?
- You're embarrassing me.

221
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,580
You don't want to go, right?

222
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,649
No.

223
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:06,310
It's been a while since I last saw him.
So I'm so excited.

224
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,749
I see.

225
00:13:08,019 --> 00:13:09,220
Then can you give me
a piggyback ride?

226
00:13:10,119 --> 00:13:11,149
What?

227
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,970
My daughter-in-law is about
to cost me a friend of 20 years.

228
00:13:24,369 --> 00:13:27,639
Given the nature of the program,
I couldn't give you a heads-up.

229
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,109
There's a line you mustn't cross
to disgrace your own family.

230
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,540
This kind of action shows...

231
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,940
the importance
of coming from a good family.

232
00:13:35,509 --> 00:13:38,109
I'm the one disgracing our family.

233
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,080
I'm cooped up in my room
and writing a novel.

234
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,220
If I cut my ties with you,

235
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,320
I'll be an orphan too.

236
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,649
So I wouldn't have come
from a good family.

237
00:13:46,590 --> 00:13:48,359
I got a business card
from a reporter earlier.

238
00:13:48,889 --> 00:13:50,560
Should I call the reporter
and tell the truth?

239
00:13:50,859 --> 00:13:53,029
That you only accepted her
as your daughter-in-law...

240
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:54,229
because I declared...

241
00:13:54,229 --> 00:13:56,729
I would live the rest of my life,
unmarried if you didn't.

242
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,800
To carry on the family name,
you had no choice but to comply.

243
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:05,040
After having a huge fight
with your son last year,

244
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,879
you told the couple not to visit you
until she got pregnant.

245
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:14,619
But you finally saw them again
after months for an interview.

246
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:17,920
This is nothing but a show.

247
00:14:18,249 --> 00:14:19,389
Seol Woo Jae.

248
00:14:23,659 --> 00:14:25,229
I'm sorry, Father.

249
00:14:27,129 --> 00:14:29,129
Gosh.

250
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,509
Here.

251
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:44,350
Gosh.

252
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,249
Your coat.

253
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:52,720
You're tired, aren't you?

254
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:59,889
Don't lie down on the sofa.
Get changed and lie down in bed.

255
00:14:59,989 --> 00:15:02,729
My energy is drained.
I don't want to do anything...

256
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:04,629
because of somebody.

257
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:15,409
I told you to let him have his way.

258
00:15:16,310 --> 00:15:18,149
He thinks that he lost you to me.

259
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,950
I couldn't watch him
criticize you like that.

260
00:15:29,489 --> 00:15:32,590
Well, it was wrong of me
not to listen to my wife.

261
00:15:35,159 --> 00:15:36,229
Wait.

262
00:15:42,139 --> 00:15:43,340
Ta-da.

263
00:15:45,369 --> 00:15:46,440
What's this?

264
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,940
Have you forgotten what today is?

265
00:15:50,609 --> 00:15:53,279
It's not my birthday.
It's not our wedding anniversary.

266
00:15:56,019 --> 00:15:57,820
The first episode
of "Nothing Uncovered" aired...

267
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,989
on this date three years ago.

268
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,320
It's a present to celebrate
its third anniversary.

269
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,259
I had forgotten about it.

270
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:08,930
Wasn't this really expensive?

271
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:10,769
It was slightly pricey even for me.

272
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,800
Put it on me.

273
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,810
Congratulations.

274
00:16:21,009 --> 00:16:22,710
Look. How do I look?

275
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:24,710
You look gorgeous.

276
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,519
Jung Won.

277
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,830
He's tenacious
at finding people's weaknesses.

278
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,460
But the only weakness
he has on you...

279
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:43,029
is that your parents aren't around.
You know that, right?

280
00:16:53,109 --> 00:16:54,810
What's your weakness then?

281
00:16:57,749 --> 00:16:58,810
My weakness?

282
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,489
You.

283
00:17:05,550 --> 00:17:06,590
Gosh.

284
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,220
It's Seo Jung Won.

285
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:50,730
("Nothing Uncovered")

286
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,879
Good morning, Jung Won.

287
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,149
To me, a good morning means...

288
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,320
It's the list of people
Lee Yi Jin targeted as victims.

289
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,250
These VIPs received snow crabs
as a present from Lee Yi Jin.

290
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:12,619
Reporters and prosecutors...

291
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,060
along with politicians
were on the list.

292
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:17,260
It is indeed a good morning.

293
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:24,530
Our rookie obtained...

294
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:25,500
the list of people
Lee Yi Jin sent presents to.

295
00:18:25,669 --> 00:18:28,639
Hey, you need to share that
with all of us.

296
00:18:28,869 --> 00:18:30,510
How come she's always
the first one to get it?

297
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,540
Gosh. You and your criticism.

298
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,080
Compliment him
when he does a good job.

299
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,550
Assemblyman Mo
reached out to you yesterday, right?

300
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,909
What nonsense did he say?

301
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:42,379
Calling me had been a ritual
for everyone I had exposed so far.

302
00:18:42,719 --> 00:18:43,949
But he skipped it.

303
00:18:43,949 --> 00:18:45,949
Is that so?

304
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,119
Oh, right.
I heard this in the morning.

305
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:51,129
Mo Hyung Taek has been sponsoring
Cha Eun Sae.

306
00:18:51,629 --> 00:18:52,859
The actress, Cha Eun Sae?

307
00:18:52,859 --> 00:18:55,629
Everything she says is
basically a lie. It's fake news.

308
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,600
Ae Na, if you keep this up,
you'll go to prison. Stop it.

309
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong.

310
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:03,199
His press conference is at 1 p.m.
Let's just watch that.

311
00:19:04,909 --> 00:19:07,780
Regardless of the reason,
my unsavory behaviors...

312
00:19:08,409 --> 00:19:11,550
cause great concern
and worry among the public.

313
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,510
For that, I apologize.

314
00:19:16,619 --> 00:19:19,149
Look at that. Even the mighty snake
is bowing down on camera...

315
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:20,419
after Jung Won exposed him.

316
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,320
You need to be careful.

317
00:19:22,359 --> 00:19:25,659
Mo Hyung Taek will try
to get back at you for this.

318
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:28,359
I might attack him one more time
before he does that.

319
00:19:28,899 --> 00:19:30,030
I'm going to the police station.

320
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,379
I found something new
on Mo Hyung Taek.

321
00:19:43,179 --> 00:19:45,179
(Mueon City chemical plant fire)

322
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:47,419
(Bongto's chemical plant

You're Reporter Seo Jung Won
from "Nothing Uncovered." Right?

326
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,719
Yes. You're an actress.
Ms. Cha Eun Sae, right?

327
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:23,949
Do you know me?

328
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:26,649
Of course.

329
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:28,389
I've gotten quite popular this year.

330
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:31,530
I'm a fan.

331
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,929
I always watch...

332
00:20:32,929 --> 00:20:35,429
your show, "Nothing Uncovered,"
every Friday.

333
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:38,530
Thank you.

334
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:40,300
By the way, what brings you here?

335
00:20:40,330 --> 00:20:42,639
I filed a lawsuit against people
who left hate comments.

336
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:45,369
I had to be questioned
as the plaintiff.

337
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:49,040
Apparently, a certain assemblyman
has been sponsoring me.

338
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:51,080
That's ridiculous.

339
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:53,709
Oh, right.

340
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:54,679
Mo Hyung Taek has been sponsoring
Cha Eun Sae.

341
00:20:55,619 --> 00:20:57,050
But I have a boyfriend.

342
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,350
We've been dating
for almost a year now.

343
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:00,959
I can't wait to marry him.

344
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,060
Oh, right.

345
00:21:03,159 --> 00:21:05,129
Your husband writes novels,
doesn't he?

346
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:08,429
My boyfriend is a writer too.

347
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,570
I see.

348
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:13,800
Oh, that necklace.

349
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,699
It's from Herzeus, right?

350
00:21:15,699 --> 00:21:17,139
It's so pretty.

351
00:21:17,139 --> 00:21:19,369
I know it was a limited edition.
It must've been hard to get.

352
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,810
My husband got it for me.

353
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,909
I see.

354
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:27,280
Ms. Seo,
can we take a picture together?

355
00:21:27,649 --> 00:21:29,480
- Here.
- Yes. Why not?

356
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,189
Since we're taking a selfie
together,

357
00:21:33,189 --> 00:21:35,919
can you grab me by the collar?

358
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:38,230
You did nothing wrong,

359
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:39,459
so I'll put my arm
around your shoulder.

360
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:44,730
Okay, I'll take it now.
One, two, three.

361
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,030
We've located
Lee Yi Jin's burner phone.

362
00:22:13,129 --> 00:22:14,260
I'll head over there now.

363
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:30,909
Yes.

364
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,480
See the low-rise apartment building
on your right?

365
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,580
Take the third alley you see.

366
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:38,889
- Yes.
- Keep walking in your two o'clock.

367
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,730
It's a dead end.

368
00:22:51,399 --> 00:22:52,429
Really?

369
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:54,139
Hold on.

370
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,199
The GPS signal dropped.

371
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,040
This jerk must've turned off
the burner phone.

372
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,830
What's wrong?

373
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,199
Excuse me.

374
00:24:02,469 --> 00:24:03,570
Excuse me.

375
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,780
Excuse me. Hello?

376
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,850
Hello? Look at me!

377
00:25:14,209 --> 00:25:15,409
When I got here,

378
00:25:17,139 --> 00:25:18,709
she was already dead.

379
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,260
The team from the NFS
is on their way.

380
00:25:32,990 --> 00:25:35,159
Ms. Seo, are you all right?

381
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,000
I think she should be seen
by a doctor.

382
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,429
She's the first witness.
She'll have to come with us.

383
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:14,540
I'll take your statement now.

384
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,240
Please describe the situation
and what you saw.

385
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:20,070
When I was passing by the alleyway,

386
00:26:22,909 --> 00:26:23,980
I saw someone...

387
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:26,310
on the balcony.

388
00:26:27,879 --> 00:26:29,179
Blood was dripping down.

389
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:34,359
The door wasn't locked,
so I went inside.

390
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:40,330
Why were you at the scene?

391
00:26:41,429 --> 00:26:42,500
Lee Yi Jin...

392
00:26:43,959 --> 00:26:45,500
I received a tip-off
about his location,

393
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,199
so I was trying to track him down.

394
00:26:49,199 --> 00:26:51,270
It was a dead end,
so I turned around...

395
00:26:52,909 --> 00:26:54,209
and happened to see her,

396
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:58,679
so I went inside
to see if she was alive.

397
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,280
Did you see anyone
who looked suspicious?

398
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,149
No.

399
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:08,090
Yes, have you identified the victim?

400
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:10,760
What?

401
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:13,689
Okay.

402
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,639
Did you and the victim
know each other?

403
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,310
How would I know who the victim was?

404
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:28,340
So you're saying you didn't
approach her intentionally?

405
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,409
"Intentionally?"

406
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:31,350
What are you saying?

407
00:27:33,379 --> 00:27:35,419
What on earth happened?

408
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,659
Ms. Jin was murdered?

409
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,100
Yes, it's nuts.

410
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,230
Detective Kim, I'm sure you heard...

411
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,830
the victim was
Assemblyman Mo's housekeeper.

412
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:56,740
He's the detective
in charge of the case.

Lieutenant Kim Tae Heon.

414
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:01,810
It only happened
a couple of hours ago.

415
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:02,879
Why are you here?

416
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,810
What do you think? I called him.

417
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,480
The victim
actually missed work today.

418
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,619
Without calling in advance?

419
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:11,889
She texted. She said she wasn't
feeling well and needed a day off.

420
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:13,520
Ms. Seo, what were you doing...

421
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,859
at the scene of Ms. Jin's murder?

422
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,459
Was slandering me on a TV show
not enough for you?

423
00:28:19,459 --> 00:28:20,730
What are you cooking up this time?

424
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:22,830
I just happened to be walking by...

425
00:28:23,899 --> 00:28:26,469
and found her on the balcony, dead.

426
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,840
You expect me to believe that?

427
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:31,169
You, Reporter Seo Jung Won,

428
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:33,270

429
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:38,179
I know you reporters
suspect everyone and everything...

430
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:40,679
you see and hear, so please
explain this from your perspective.

431
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,060
We know nothing for certain yet,

432
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,260
so please calm down, both of you.

433
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,500
Did the victim have family members
we should contact?

434
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,169
She was widowed,
and she lived alone.

436

Because of the TV show,
we have a lot to deal with at the moment,

437
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:08,139
so we hope you don't go public
with Ms. Jin's identity for now.

438
00:29:12,949 --> 00:29:15,250
Sir, we'll be in touch again
after further investigation,

439
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,919
so you should go home.

440
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:18,449
All right.

441
00:29:18,649 --> 00:29:20,850
I really hope...

442
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:23,490
you catch the killer soon.

443
00:29:25,490 --> 00:29:27,560

Is it not? You hear it too, right?

457

Oh, it must be
our upstairs neighbor's phone.

458

I'd say it was a robbery, right?

so it fits Ms. Seo's statement.

485
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,139
She was stabbed in the stomach,

486
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,909
and probably died
trying to flee the attacker.

487
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,819
Do you often suffer from insomnia?

488
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,089
I often stay up all night to work.

489
00:34:25,989 --> 00:34:27,029
Then...

490
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:30,130
Even though you're a journalist,

491
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:34,069
was this your first time
seeing a dead body?

492
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:37,940
It wasn't my first time.

493
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,739
When else did you see one?

494
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:42,339
Was it for work?

495
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:47,949
Was it similar to the sight
from yesterday or...

496
00:34:47,949 --> 00:34:50,080
I'm a bit busy.

497
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:52,150
Just write me a prescription.

498
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,830
Will this one broadcast
change the world?

499
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,429
It won't.

500
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:08,940
However, until it does change,
I won't stop...

501
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
uncovering everything criminal.

502
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,770
This part was so moving.

503
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,610
Since then,
I've watched every episode.

504
00:35:15,610 --> 00:35:19,049
Through your show,
you exposed many criminals,

505
00:35:19,549 --> 00:35:21,350
and comforted the victims.

506
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:25,350
I want to help you, the person
who did what no one else could.

507
00:35:27,049 --> 00:35:29,560
So that you can recover quickly,

508
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,119
let's work together.

509
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,400
(Reporter Seo Jung Won suspected of
destroying murder scene)

510
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,040
A woman is dead,

511
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,710
and the public's attention
is warped.

512
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:54,549
I express my regret
that Seo Jung Won...

513
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,819
reported something scandalous
and roped me into it.

514
00:35:59,319 --> 00:36:01,190
So she walked in on us talking.

515
00:36:01,219 --> 00:36:04,259
Is it right for a journalist
to report immediately...

516
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,330
in desperation
to secure an exclusive?

517
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:10,230
With what intention did she visit
my housekeeper late at night?

518
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,699
Another reporter suggested...

519
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:15,069
she contaminated the crime scene.

520
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:17,270
- I think...
- Seo Jung Won!

521
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,869
What's the problem?

522
00:36:18,869 --> 00:36:21,239
I don't get why you're so upset.

523
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:23,880
Did I report a complete lie?

524
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,750
Don't glare at me.
Speak up if you want to.

525
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,219
It's a shame I'm too late.

526
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:32,420
I was going to tip off my junior.

527
00:36:32,719 --> 00:36:33,790
You really move fast.

528
00:36:33,790 --> 00:36:37,089
Sure.
Go on acting like you're special.

529
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:40,630
And don't read the nasty comments
about you that are under my article.

530
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,670
What is it?

531
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:53,210
People know I don't read comments,
so they're texting me instead.

532
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,310
"Do you want to write about
seeing a body?"

533
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,440
"She's psycho."

534
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:59,210
"You killed her for the exclusive,
didn't you?"

535
00:36:59,279 --> 00:37:01,049
"The murderer who messed up
the scene should go."

536
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,650
You exposed them,

537
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:06,819
so now Mo Hyung Taek
and No Ji Ho are coming for you.

538
00:37:06,819 --> 00:37:09,560
Do you want me
to hide and starve, then?

539
00:37:13,389 --> 00:37:14,529
I'm going home.

540
00:37:15,029 --> 00:37:16,060
Bye.

541
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,580
(Uncover your husband
before you uncover others)

542
00:37:31,009 --> 00:37:32,449
This is just insane.

543
00:37:32,549 --> 00:37:34,850
What is it? Is something wrong?

544
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,880
"Uncover your husband
before you uncover others."

545
00:37:39,089 --> 00:37:41,319
Earlier,
someone texted to call me...

546
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:42,860
Mo's housekeeper's killer.

547
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,920
What?

548
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:46,130
Who was it? Give me the number.

549
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,460
They're fake numbers.
You can't reach them.

550
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:51,199
From now on,
I'll get screencaps of the texts...

551
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,799
- and report them.
- You should.

552
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,940
I'll call Mr. Moon the lawyer.

553
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,639
Where are we going?

554
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:05,679
(The late Seo Sang Gyeon)

555
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,679
I thought...

556
00:38:11,719 --> 00:38:13,920
you'd miss your father
even more today.

557
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:18,060
My dad...

558
00:38:19,389 --> 00:38:20,960
ended an article with this line.

559
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,730
"Ignore the truth
and you will pay the price."

560
00:38:27,929 --> 00:38:29,600
I won't run away.

561
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:31,369
You can run away sometimes.

562
00:38:32,409 --> 00:38:33,509
You have me.

563
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,949
I'm so relieved to have you.

564
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,659
I'll be there for you forever.

565
00:39:01,670 --> 00:39:03,940
(One month later)

566
00:39:25,989 --> 00:39:27,989
Jung Won.

567
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:30,130
Wake up.

568
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:39,639
Did you sleep well?

569
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:43,880
You didn't have a nightmare
last night?

570
00:39:52,049 --> 00:39:53,250
You have therapy today, right?

571
00:39:53,989 --> 00:39:55,020
Yes.

572
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:04,929
(How come you're not uncovering
your deceiving husband?)

573
00:40:06,569 --> 00:40:09,100
What is it? Did something go wrong?

574
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:11,940
Remember the text message I got...

575
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,440
from a long number
about a month ago?

576
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:14,469
Yes, I do.

577
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,610
Just like that time, I got
another message from a long number.

578
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,139
Like this.

579
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:21,179
What is this?

580
00:40:21,179 --> 00:40:22,819
This is going too far.

581
00:40:23,350 --> 00:40:24,719
You said you submitted
the text messages...

582
00:40:24,719 --> 00:40:26,449
when you filed a lawsuit
against the online haters, right?

583
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,259
I did. But the police
couldn't track them down.

584
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,060
Let's just ignore it.

585
00:40:35,029 --> 00:40:37,360
Wasting our energy on a useless text
like this would be our loss.

586
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,699
Right.

587
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:43,839
Honey.

588
00:40:47,369 --> 00:40:49,110
You're not hiding anything from me,
right?

589
00:40:50,179 --> 00:40:51,339
Are you serious?

590
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,080
Other people will get suspicious
when they get messages like this.

591
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,319
Wouldn't you feel the same?

592
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:57,179
No. I wouldn't.

593
00:40:58,819 --> 00:40:59,920
Then I've got nothing to say.

594
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,089
Okay. I'll ignore it like you said.

595
00:41:08,529 --> 00:41:09,699
Come on, don't be mad.

596
00:41:10,029 --> 00:41:13,000
I need to see your smile
for me to have a good day.

597
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,369
Please?

598
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,739
- Please?
- Stop it.

599
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:22,940
Stop it.

600
00:41:25,949 --> 00:41:27,080
Seriously.

601
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,150
- Stop it.
- How about now?

602
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,690
- Stop it. You're cute.
- Now?

603
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:38,659
I know what I want for dinner.
I'm craving your pasta.

604
00:41:38,989 --> 00:41:40,230
You'll come home early, right?

605
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:49,139
My dad showed up in my dream.

606
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,710
When he won
the Reporter of the Year,

607
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,409
he was over the moon
like a little kid.

608
00:41:55,409 --> 00:41:56,610
That day is still vivid in my head.

609

(30th Award Presentation
for the Reporter of the Year)

610

Reporter Seo Sang Gyeon rocks!
He's the best!

611
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,020
I had no idea back then...

612
00:42:07,989 --> 00:42:10,389
that he would pass away
two months later.

613
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,929
Your father was a reporter.

614
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,730
I'm sorry for your loss.

615
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:20,299
He wasn't just a regular reporter.

616
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,339
He was a reporter
with the nickname, Scoop Hunter.

617
00:42:23,770 --> 00:42:25,369
You followed in his footsteps...

618
00:42:25,770 --> 00:42:27,540
and became the best reporter.

619
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,540
You no longer have nightmares.

620
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:32,210

- Thank you.

624

Who's the culprit?

631
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:17,049
I would like to know
the answer to that too.

632
00:44:17,679 --> 00:44:18,690
To know who killed him.

Marriage fraud? Don't you think
that lacks a punch?

642
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:51,779
The husband isn't
the only con artist.

643

His parents are also wanted

Everyone in the family

That's not all.
Three women married this con artist.

Well, try to get people's attention
with that then.

00:45:04,659 --> 00:45:05,699
What's this?

648
00:45:07,299 --> 00:45:08,330
Hey, what is it?

649
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:10,600
What?

650
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,710
I'll talk to you later.

651
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:14,810
Darn it. Come on.

652
00:45:16,139 --> 00:45:18,779
Hae Jun got arrested
for violating the anti-graft law.

653
00:45:18,779 --> 00:45:20,909
He accepted bribes?
That greedy jerk.

654
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,920
Gosh. After all the support
I had given him?

655
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,179
I knew he would cause trouble!

656
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:26,619
Oh, my. He acted so righteously.

657
00:45:26,619 --> 00:45:28,089
But he accepted that much money
as a bribe?

658
00:45:28,089 --> 00:45:29,360
I can't believe this.

659
00:45:30,659 --> 00:45:32,290
And the interview with the informant
for our marriage fraud episode?

660
00:45:32,759 --> 00:45:33,889
The meeting is tomorrow.

661
00:45:37,529 --> 00:45:38,699
This is Seo Jung Won.

662
00:45:38,699 --> 00:45:41,029
Hello. This is Cha Eun Sae.

663
00:45:41,469 --> 00:45:42,600
Do you remember me?

664
00:45:42,670 --> 00:45:44,239
We met in the restroom
at the police station.

665
00:45:44,639 --> 00:45:47,670
Yes. How did you get my number?

666
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:48,880
I got it from my manager.

667
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:51,540
I was wondering...

668
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,909
if you could come to my house
right now.

669
00:45:54,449 --> 00:45:56,049
- Now?
- There's something...

670
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:58,049
I must tell you urgently.

671
00:45:57,779 --> 00:45:59,889
You know, I thought a lot about this
before reading out.

672
00:45:59,889 --> 00:46:01,989
I had to muster up the courage
to call you.

673
00:46:02,589 --> 00:46:04,690
I thought it was now or never.

674
00:46:05,259 --> 00:46:07,290
I really hope you will help me.

675
00:46:08,159 --> 00:46:10,330
I'll be there. Text me your address.

676
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,400
What is it?

677
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:15,130
Cha Eun Sae said there was
something she had to tell me.

678
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:16,839
What? That was Cha Eun Sae
on the phone just now?

679
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:18,270
Are you guys close?

680
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,270
We ran into each other...

681
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,770
- about a month ago.
- Yes.

682
00:46:21,339 --> 00:46:22,610
She asked to meet me.

683
00:46:22,610 --> 00:46:23,880
Right now?

684
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,310
I'm getting a feeling
this scoop will be huge.

685
00:46:26,310 --> 00:46:28,310
I'll go and get it before
she gives it to someone else.

686
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,400
Come on in.

687
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,750
("High Risk" by Seol Woo Jae)

688
00:47:06,489 --> 00:47:08,389
(Detective novel by Seol Woo Jae,
"Blue Murderer")

689
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,489
This is the same necklace as the one
you were wearing before, right?

690
00:47:13,429 --> 00:47:14,960
You're not wearing that today.

691
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,630
No, I'm not.

692
00:47:20,869 --> 00:47:23,199
You must be a fan
of my husband's novels.

693
00:47:23,199 --> 00:47:24,900
I don't like his novels,

694
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,540
but I like Mr. Seol Woo Jae.

695
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,639
Thank you.

696
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,279
Why are you thanking me?

697
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:35,210
I just told you that
I loved your husband.

698
00:47:36,449 --> 00:47:38,690
- Pardon?
- I love your husband.

699
00:47:39,589 --> 00:47:41,690
And your husband loves me back.

700
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,190
What did you say?

701
00:47:47,429 --> 00:47:49,199
I told you
I had something to tell you.

702
00:47:52,270 --> 00:47:53,900
We're in love.

703
00:47:55,199 --> 00:47:56,369
We're in a relationship.

704
00:47:57,639 --> 00:47:59,969
He bought this necklace for me too.

705
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:05,710
You're in a relationship
with my husband? Since when?

706
00:48:05,710 --> 00:48:07,880
I already told you
when we met in the restroom.

707
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:09,949
We've been dating
for almost a year now.

708
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:12,219
I can't wait to marry him.

709
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,089
Your husband writes novels,
doesn't he?

710
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,560
My boyfriend is a writer too.

711
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:24,860
I gave you a hint too.

712
00:48:25,529 --> 00:48:26,929
I told you to uncover your husband.

713
00:48:27,429 --> 00:48:28,799
And that he was deceiving you.

714
00:48:31,139 --> 00:48:32,210
You're the one...

715
00:48:33,440 --> 00:48:34,770
who sent the text message?

716
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:36,409
Unlike the sharp reporter
you pretended to be,

717
00:48:36,409 --> 00:48:38,540
it seemed you were clueless
about your husband.

718
00:48:42,009 --> 00:48:43,779
I got the first message a month ago.

719
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:46,819
If you were truly
behind the message,

720
00:48:47,250 --> 00:48:48,860
how come you didn't reach out to me
for a month?

721
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:51,119
Why did you send me
the second message today?

722
00:48:55,259 --> 00:48:56,630
Woo Jae told me that...

723
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,799
he was going to divorce you
in a month and asked me to wait.

724
00:49:00,299 --> 00:49:02,940
So I waited for a month.
But he didn't divorce you.

725
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:06,239
I sent you the message
as I was impatient.

726
00:49:06,239 --> 00:49:07,509
Do you expect me to believe this?

727
00:49:12,509 --> 00:49:15,350
It's a pity that you're trying
to find excuses not to believe me.

728
00:49:16,719 --> 00:49:17,850
Too bad.

729
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:21,150
Woo Jae is the clingy one
in our relationship.

730
00:49:23,219 --> 00:49:24,989
If you are really in a relationship
with my husband,

731
00:49:25,489 --> 00:49:26,529
show me the proof.

732
00:49:26,529 --> 00:49:28,429
I don't want to. Why should I?

733
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,199
You should call him and ask...

734
00:49:31,199 --> 00:49:32,569
if he's cheating on you with me.

735
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,540
But I'm pretty sure he'll deny that.

736
00:49:40,909 --> 00:49:43,239
You led me to think you had a story
for me and made me come here.

737
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:45,380
How come
you can't show me any proof?

738
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:47,110
You're just all talk.

739
00:49:47,110 --> 00:49:48,819
I told you the truth.

740
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,520
Finding the proof will be your job.

741
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:53,489
Isn't that what reporters
are supposed to do?

742
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:58,619
"Viewers of 'Nothing Uncovered.'"

743
00:49:58,619 --> 00:50:00,759
"Did my husband, Seol Woo Jae,"

744
00:50:00,759 --> 00:50:02,730
"really cheat on me
with Cha Eun Sae?"

745
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:03,860
Is this fun for you?

746
00:50:06,569 --> 00:50:09,100
I bet you want to grab me
by the collar like this right now.

747
00:50:09,699 --> 00:50:12,369
Actually, no. Do you want
to slap me in the face?

748
00:50:13,139 --> 00:50:14,440
If you want to slap me, go ahead.

749
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,880
Slap me all you want.

750
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:23,380
You're not even worth my time.

751
00:50:26,889 --> 00:50:27,989
Divorce him.

752
00:50:29,819 --> 00:50:31,319
I'll never leave him.

753
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:35,330
Divorce him as soon as you can
if you want to get hurt less.

754
00:50:41,869 --> 00:50:42,900
Listen carefully.

755
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,610
It's up to me to decide
whether or not I'll get hurt.

756
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,739
The same goes for whether or not
we'll get a divorce.

757
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:49,239
Regardless of whether
you're right or wrong,

758
00:50:50,279 --> 00:50:52,509
there's nothing you can decide.
Do you know why that is?

759
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:54,279
Because you're a nobody to me.

760
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,549
I knew you were a weirdo,

761
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,420
but I didn't know
you were this crazy.

762
00:51:11,029 --> 00:51:12,100
Wait.

763
00:51:15,130 --> 00:51:16,569
I forgot to give you something.

764
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:19,670
Here, it's a gift.

765
00:51:36,659 --> 00:51:37,960
I'm three months pregnant.

766
00:51:38,119 --> 00:51:39,929
I thought you should know.

767
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,199
Why should I know about this?

768
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:51,770
First, how am I supposed to believe
you're pregnant, just based on this?

769
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:54,009
You're an actress, after all.

770
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,210
In my eyes,

771
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,380
this just looks like bad acting.

772
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:01,880
Second, let's say
you're actually pregnant.

773
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,380
But how am I supposed to believe
that my husband is the father?

774
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:09,690
Just a month ago, rumors were
rampant that you had a sponsor.

775
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,000
Earlier, you provoked me
to go ahead and slap you,

776
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:27,139
but you ended up
slapping me instead.

777
00:53:13,489 --> 00:53:16,020
We know nothing other than
the time and cause of Jin's death...

778
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:18,089
and the person who found her.
We need something else to get a lead.

779
00:53:18,489 --> 00:53:19,790
She had no family or friends.

780
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,759
No hostile relationships.
All we know is she worked for Mo.

781
00:53:21,759 --> 00:53:23,860
Shall we call him here again
and interrogate him?

782
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:25,460
You punk. Have you lost your mind?

783
00:53:26,869 --> 00:53:29,069
My gosh. You can't yell
as loudly as you used to.

784
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:30,369
It makes me sad.

785
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:40,679
Why are you here at this hour?

786
00:53:43,779 --> 00:53:44,850
What brings you here?

787
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:50,589
I'm here to get some information
on Lee Yi Jin's case.

788
00:53:50,589 --> 00:53:51,619
Lee Yi Jin's case?

789
00:53:52,860 --> 00:53:54,690
- What about it?
- I'm covering the case.

790
00:53:54,889 --> 00:53:56,159
Detective Oh is gone for the day.

791
00:53:56,860 --> 00:53:57,900
And I'm busy too.

792
00:54:12,179 --> 00:54:13,810
Why are you so out of it?

793
00:54:13,810 --> 00:54:15,049
I was thinking about something else.

794
00:54:15,049 --> 00:54:16,750
Get in my car. I'll take you home.

795
00:54:17,449 --> 00:54:18,480
It's fine.

796
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:21,549
I'm going that way too.
Just get in the car.

797
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:37,000
You don't look like
you're feeling well.

798
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:38,639
I have a headache.

799
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,480
(My Husband)

800
00:54:48,509 --> 00:54:49,880
Wait here.
I'll pick up some medicine.

801
00:55:00,429 --> 00:55:01,589
(My Husband)

802
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:05,000
Yes.

803
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,699
I called you earlier. Where are you?

804
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:09,139
I'm in front of the house.
What about you?

805
00:55:09,639 --> 00:55:11,639
I'm at the studio.

806
00:55:10,940 --> 00:55:13,170
It looks like I have to work
all night because of the deadline.

807
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:14,739
Don't stay up to wait for me.
Just go to bed.

808
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:18,339
Oh, right. You asked me
to make pasta for dinner.

809
00:55:19,009 --> 00:55:21,350
Sorry. You haven't eaten yet, right?
I'll leave now.

810
00:55:21,350 --> 00:55:23,350
Don't.

811
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,449
I've eaten.

812
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,049
I have to work all night too.

813
00:55:27,319 --> 00:55:28,850
- Really?
- Yes.

814
00:55:29,619 --> 00:55:31,889
All right. Don't work too hard.

815
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:34,659
I love you.

816
00:55:35,259 --> 00:55:36,529
Do you really love me?

817
00:55:36,529 --> 00:55:37,699
Of course, I do.

818
00:55:41,069 --> 00:55:43,069
I'll see you tomorrow.

819
00:56:17,139 --> 00:56:19,170
Thank you. Thanks for the ride too.

824

- Babe.
- Hey, there you are.

825
00:59:19,049 --> 00:59:21,319
- I'm done.
- What did the doctor say? All good?

826
00:59:21,319 --> 00:59:22,650
- Everything's fine.
- Isn't that Seo Jung Won?

827
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:24,920
Yes, from "Nothing Uncovered."

828
00:59:24,920 --> 00:59:26,230
What's she doing
at an ob-gyn clinic?

829
00:59:26,830 --> 00:59:28,960
Honey, she's prettier in real life.

830
00:59:30,460 --> 00:59:32,360
Isn't she that TV reporter,
Seo Jung Won?

831
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,830
From "Nothing Uncovered," right?

832
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,170
- Why is she here?
- Is she pregnant?

833

(With Me With You

834
01:00:08,429 --> 01:00:10,900
- Hey.
- Jung Won, are you on your way now?

835
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:12,400
Right.

836
01:00:13,639 --> 01:00:14,909
Where's the interview again?

837
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:17,610
Hello.

838
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:20,949
Over here.

839
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:28,650
What?

840
01:00:27,850 --> 01:00:30,089
My goodness.
Someone didn't go home last night.

841
01:00:30,089 --> 01:00:32,159
You're wearing
the exact same clothes as yesterday.

842
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:33,190
Did you and your husband
have a fight?

843
01:00:35,489 --> 01:00:36,560
No, neither.

844
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:38,400
Is the informant on their way now?

845
01:00:38,630 --> 01:00:39,699
Well, the thing is...

846
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:43,040
They can't leave home due to their
panic attacks and anxiety disorder.

847
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:47,710
By the way, what did Cha Eun Sae...

848
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,509
tip you off about yesterday?

849
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,880
About her sponsor? Drugs?
Or about entertaining people in power?

850
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,150
No, it was nothing important.

851
01:01:00,549 --> 01:01:01,719
I wouldn't even call it a tip-off.

852
01:01:02,119 --> 01:01:03,690
Are you kidding me?
That's disappointing.

853
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:06,389
You don't look too well today.

854
01:01:08,389 --> 01:01:09,500
I should go home.

855
01:01:22,710 --> 01:01:25,009
I'll be about ten minutes late.

856
01:01:25,580 --> 01:01:26,710
Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

863
01:04:16,949 --> 01:04:19,850
Just like Jin, Cha was stabbed
multiple times in the stomach.

864
01:04:19,850 --> 01:04:20,989
Why is it just like that time?

865
01:04:21,319 --> 01:04:23,119
- What is this?
- Could it belong to the killer?

866
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:24,389
Cha Eun Sae is dead!

867
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:27,159
It means she died
the day after you met her.

868
01:04:27,159 --> 01:04:28,190
What's with that face?

869
01:04:28,190 --> 01:04:29,259
Jung Won.

870
01:04:29,290 --> 01:04:31,000
Shall I tell you something shocking?

871
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,270
Cha Eun Sae was
three months pregnant.

872
01:04:34,529 --> 01:04:37,069
Why did you go to
the marriage counseling clinic yesterday?

873
01:04:37,699 --> 01:04:39,000
Did you follow me?

874
01:04:39,469 --> 01:04:42,139
So she was murdered, right?
Do you have a suspect?

875
01:04:42,139 --> 01:04:43,210
Have you identified
the main suspect?

876
01:04:43,210 --> 01:04:45,540
Was something going on between
Ms. Seo's husband and Cha Eun Sae?

877
01:04:45,739 --> 01:04:48,009
Who was the visitor
that picked up this cake?

878
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,350
I came to ask you a few questions
about Cha Eun Sae.
